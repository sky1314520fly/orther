# Final verification

## Review verdict

All five review-work lanes returned unconditional PASS on HEAD `e9ffb1e97`:

- Goal and constraint verification: PASS
- Code quality: PASS
- Security: PASS
- Hands-on QA: PASS
- GitHub/git/context mining: PASS

## Full repository gate

Command:

```bash
bun test
```

Result:

- 12,143 pass
- 3 pre-existing skips
- 0 fail
- 2 snapshots
- 83,310 assertions
- 1,553 test files

The skipped tests are existing live-platform smokes:

- team-mode live tmux smoke
- Windows named-pipe LSP daemon ownership
- duplicate team-mode live tmux smoke registration

No skip was added or changed by this work.

After the PR was ready, current green `dev` (`ad951348f`) advanced. It was
merged without conflicts, dependencies were refreshed with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`, and the full repository gate above was rerun.

## Final static gates

- `bun run typecheck`: PASS
- `bun run build`: PASS
- Strict TypeScript audit on all small edited source/test files: PASS
- Built-in LSP diagnostics could not target the sibling worktree because the
  tool enforces the original session cwd; full `tsgo` package diagnostics were
  used without suppression.

## Final live surfaces

- OpenCode 1.18.4 loaded the rebuilt local plugin in isolated XDG sandboxes.
- `/config` listed the worktree `dist/index.js`.
- Official SSE probes observed `session.created`.
- Real OpenCode database session count remained 21,931.
- Unauthenticated inline cmux spawned eager `opencode attach` and closed via
  `send-keys C-c` plus `kill-pane`.
- Authenticated cmux pane/window/session spawns failed before credentials
  reached the runner.
- Both shell-injection probe files remained absent.

## Cleanup

- QA ports 45481, 45482, 45483, 45509, and 45511 are listener-free.
- All task-owned QA temp directories are absent.
- Both injection probe paths are absent.
- The only remaining OpenCode server, port 62803, predates this task and belongs
  to another worktree.

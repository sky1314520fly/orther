// Memorian gate wiring (plan .omo/plans/memorian-m3-gate.md todo 8): the settle-side half of the

// the reflection trigger's session_compact seam call in - because the gate must observe exactly the
// turns those handlers already agreed were complete.
//
// Nothing here is awaited by the host. A settle returns the instant the work is queued: the gate is
// advisory, and a turn must never pay for the advice about the turn that just ended.

// Memorian gate runner (plan .omo/plans/memorian-m3-gate.md todo 7).
//
// At settle, when lexical candidates exist, ONE quick-category child judges them against the recent
// transcript and answers only through the nudge tool. The launch follows the facts runner's
// semantics - resolveReflectionModel("quick"), warn+skip when the category cannot resolve, no
// fallback ladder, one activeLaunch latch - but carries NO durable machinery: there is no queue, no
// failure store and no run ledger, because a gate run that dies is simply a turn without a nudge.
//
// The judge runs IN-PROCESS through senpi-task's InProcessRunner, exactly like the curated
// read-only agents: the child's ResourceLoader has no builtin extensions (no hooks lock can fail
// under it), and it shares the parent snapshot's modelRegistry/authStorage/modelRuntime so engine
// skew is impossible. Its single input is INLINED in the prompt - the candidates payload plus the
// transcript window - so the child needs no file access and no read tool; its single output is the
// nudge closure, which validates against the launch input synchronously and records accepted
// nudges into an array this runner owns. The run directory holds the same payload as
// human-auditable artifacts and is KEPT after the run (pruning is a deliberate non-goal).

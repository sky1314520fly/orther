// authoritative: every collected nudge is re-validated against the candidate set, the session
// ledger, the hint shape and the configured cap (defence in depth - the closure already
// enforced the same rules at call time).
//
// Accepted nudges wait in a per-session pending file until the next turn injects
// them. The payload is self-describing ({ version, sessionId, compactionEpoch,
// writtenAt, nudges }) so a filename collision from session-id sanitization can
// never hand one session another session's nudges, so a payload nobody consumed
// expires instead of surfacing days later, and so a verdict about a transcript a
// compaction has since rewritten is rejected AT CONSUMPTION rather than raced
// against by the writer.

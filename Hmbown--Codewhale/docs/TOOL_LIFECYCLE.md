# Historical Tool-Surface Lifecycle Policy (v0.8.53)

> 阅读简体中文版：[zh_hans/TOOL_LIFECYCLE.md](zh_hans/TOOL_LIFECYCLE.md)

**Status:** Historical design record, not current runtime documentation. The
v0.9.1 canonical action surface and replay-only alias contract are documented in
[`RUNTIME_SIMPLIFICATION_DESIGN.md`](RUNTIME_SIMPLIFICATION_DESIGN.md) and
[`TOOL_SURFACE.md`](TOOL_SURFACE.md). No catalog code landed in this old cycle — the code
work is **deferred**. This document is the umbrella policy for GitHub **#2681**,
with **#2682** and **#2683** as concrete instances of the planned diet. It
describes *what will be done* and the invariants any future diet PR must hold.

**Scope of related open work (do not contradict):**
- PR **#2684** — subagent role vocabulary, lifecycle signals, eval ergonomics.
  Legacy subagent-name cleanup + guardrail tests in this policy rebase on #2684.
- PR **#2685** — git-history active + RLM/field errors.

**What actually happened, so you can read the rest as history:** the "hidden
compatibility" plan below was *not* what shipped in full. `exec_wait` and
`exec_interact` were removed rather than kept dispatchable. The work-progress
surface is different: `todo_write` is the sole model-visible name, while
`work_update`, `TodoWrite`, `todo`, `checklist_write`, and `checklist_update`
stay registered as hidden-compatibility aliases of `TodoWriteTool` so old
transcripts replay; `checklist_add`, `checklist_list`, `todo_add`,
`todo_update`, and `todo_list` are not registered and are not callable.
`tts`/`speech` remain dispatchable. See [`TOOL_SURFACE.md`](TOOL_SURFACE.md)
for the shipped contract. Read §4 and §8 as a rejected catalog-diet proposal,
not as a guarantee that every listed alias is gone.

**All file:line citations here were correct at v0.8.52/0.8.53 and are now
expired.** They have not been rewritten, because renumbering a historical
record makes it look current. Symbols this document cites that no longer exist
at all include `ARCEE_FIRST_TURN_NATIVE_TOOLS` and `apply_provider_tool_policy`
(both removed by `1bfcced43c`, "fix(engine): remove Arcee tool catalog
exception"), and the planned `HIDDEN_COMPATIBILITY_TOOLS` / `DEPRECATED_ALIASES`
sets, which were never written. Resolve any symbol here against the tree before
acting on it.

## 1. Purpose and the weaker-model problem

Codewhale ships a large native tool surface. The first-turn *active* partition
of that surface is what every model sees before it has run a single
`tool_search_*` call. Today that active set contains several **near-duplicate
tools** that map to the *same* implementation under different names:

- `exec_wait` and `exec_shell_wait` are both `ShellWaitTool`
  (`crates/tui/src/tools/registry.rs:526,529`).
- `exec_interact` and `exec_shell_interact` are both `ShellInteractTool`
  (`registry.rs:527,530`).
- `tts` and `speech` are both `SpeechTool`
  (`registry.rs:787-792`, both deferred).
- `todo_write` is the single model-visible `TodoWriteTool` surface;
  `todo_write`, `TodoWrite`, `todo`, `checklist_write`, and
  `checklist_update` are hidden compat aliases of it.

For a strong model, redundant names are harmless noise. For **weaker / smaller
models** (the Arcee Trinity lane, `deepseek-v4-flash` child executors, and any
non-thinking executor), every additional near-duplicate in the visible set is a
real cost:

- It widens the choice space with options that do *nothing distinct*, increasing
  wrong-tool selection and oscillation between synonyms.
- It spends scarce first-turn catalog budget (Section 5) on zero-information
  entries.
- It dilutes the "one name = one thing" contract that lets a small model reason
  about the surface at all.

The lifecycle policy exists to **shrink and discipline the model-visible
surface** without ever breaking the ability to replay an old transcript that
referenced a now-retired name.

### Canonical work-tracking surface for v0.9.1

The model-visible progress surface is a single tool: `todo_write` (#4132).
Agents and Fleet workers use it for concrete To-do / Work progress under the
active runtime thread or durable task.

`task_*` and the Fleet/Workflow ledger remain the durable lifecycle owners.
Checklist metadata is the model-visible projection of progress:
`task_updates.checklist` carries the current items, completion percentage, and
in-progress item.

**The To-do is the only Work surface.** `update_plan` is conversational
reasoning — strategy, context, and route notes for complex initiatives. It is
not a progress surface, must not duplicate To-do items, and plan-only state is
never rendered as a To-do snapshot.

**No request re-states the list.** The model learns what is on the To-do the way
it learns anything else: from the result its own `todo_write` call returned,
which is ordinary persisted history. Nothing is appended to a parent turn-loop
step or a sub-agent step. The complete list stays visible in the UI, which is a
different surface from the request.

`crates/tui/src/todo_snapshot.rs` renders the one bounded body — hard-bounded in
both item count and characters, in-progress item preserved preferentially, any
elision marked — for the three seams that show a snapshot *once*, because a
person asked: the `<codewhale:fork_state>` block a newly forked agent is handed,
`/relay`, and the in-transcript agent card.

Two properties of that renderer are load-bearing:

- **Authority.** The snapshot is read from the `WorkRuntime` graph projection
  when a runtime owns that list, because `todo_write` stages there and only
  publishes into the legacy `SharedTodoList` view later. Sessions with no
  attached runtime read the list directly.
- **Per-agent isolation.** Every agent reads *its own* list (`#4810`), so a
  worker sees its own progress and never a parent's or sibling's. The parent's
  list reaches a forked child only as the immutable `<codewhale:fork_state>`
  To-do section, resolved at the spawn seam so a same-turn `todo_write` is
  included.

The renderer bounds and frames the snapshot; it does not vet To-do content. It
guarantees that item text cannot close the wrapper early, cannot forge the line
format with control characters, and cannot exceed the item/character bounds —
not that arbitrary item text is safe to follow as instructions.

The registered hidden compatibility aliases of `todo_write` are `work_update`,
`TodoWrite`, `todo`, `checklist_write`, and `checklist_update`
(`ToolRegistryBuilder::with_todo_tool`). They remain dispatchable against the
same To-do state so old transcripts replay without data loss, but they are not
advertised to the model catalog (`TodoWriteTool::model_visible` is true only
for the canonical name). `checklist_add`, `checklist_list`, `todo_add`,
`todo_update`, and `todo_list` are not registered and are not callable.

## 2. The five lifecycle states

Every native tool name occupies exactly one lifecycle state.

| State | Meaning | Visible on first turn? | In `tool_search_*`? | Executes if called? | When used |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **active** | Canonical, in the first-turn catalog head | **Yes** | n/a (already active) | Yes | The tool a model should reach for by default |
| **deferred** | Registered + discoverable, hydrated on demand | No | **Yes** | Yes | Real, useful tools that don't earn a first-turn slot |
| **hidden-compatibility** | Registered + dispatchable, but removed from active **and** from search | No | **No** | **Yes — identical behavior, silent** | Old synonym kept only so old transcripts replay; no model should newly discover it |
| **deprecated** | Like hidden-compat, but execution **appends a replacement notice to result metadata** | No | **No** | **Yes — works, plus a "use X instead" notice** | A retired name we actively steer callers off of, still safe to replay |
| **removed** | Not registered at all | No | No | **No — hard error** | Only after `planned_removal_version`, once replay support is formally dropped |

### hidden-compatibility vs deprecated — be precise

Both states are **invisible** (not active, not in tool search) and both remain
**dispatchable** (calling them still works). The *only* difference is the
caller-facing signal:

- **hidden-compatibility:** completely silent. The tool behaves byte-for-byte
  like its canonical twin. We use this when there is *no behavioral or naming
  lesson to teach* — the name was a pure alias and we simply don't want models
  re-learning it. (Example: `exec_wait` is literally `exec_shell_wait`.)
- **deprecated:** behaves identically *and succeeds*, but the tool result's
  **metadata** carries an appended notice like
  `"deprecated: use <replacement> instead"`. The notice goes **only in the
  result metadata returned for that call** — never in the cached tool catalog
  prefix (see Section 8). We use this when there is a canonical replacement we
  want the caller (and any human reading the transcript) nudged toward.

Neither state ever changes the *behavior* of the call. Replay always works.

---

## 3. Representation in code

The lifecycle is represented as **const name-sets plus an alias/manifest table**
in `crates/tui/src/core/engine/tool_catalog.rs`, alongside the existing
`DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS` (`tool_catalog.rs:37-64`) and
`ARCEE_FIRST_TURN_NATIVE_TOOLS` (`tool_catalog.rs:106-115`).

### 3a. Name-sets and the manifest (sketch)

```rust
// crates/tui/src/core/engine/tool_catalog.rs  (planned)

/// Tools removed from the active set AND from tool-search, but still
/// registered and dispatchable with byte-identical behavior. Silent.
pub(super) const HIDDEN_COMPATIBILITY_TOOLS: &[&str] = &[
    "exec_wait",          // == exec_shell_wait  (ShellWaitTool)
    "exec_interact",      // == exec_shell_interact (ShellInteractTool)
    "tts",                // == speech (SpeechTool)
    "work_update",        // == todo_write (TodoWriteTool)
    "TodoWrite",          // == todo_write (TodoWriteTool)
    "todo",               // == todo_write (TodoWriteTool)
    "checklist_write",    // == todo_write (TodoWriteTool)
    "checklist_update",   // == todo_write (TodoWriteTool)
];

/// Deprecated aliases: invisible + dispatchable, with a replacement notice
/// appended to RESULT METADATA only (never the cached prefix).
pub(super) struct DeprecatedAlias {
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub replacement: &'static str,
    pub note: &'static str,
}

pub(super) const DEPRECATED_ALIASES: &[DeprecatedAlias] = &[
    // Empty in the #4132 work-surface cutover: the legacy names above are
    // silent hidden-compatibility aliases of todo_write for transcript replay.
];

#[inline]
pub(super) fn is_hidden_or_deprecated(name: &str) -> bool {
    HIDDEN_COMPATIBILITY_TOOLS.contains(&name)
        || DEPRECATED_ALIASES.iter().any(|d| d.name == name)
}
```

### 3b. The two filter points

1. **Catalog / tool-search exclusion (tool_catalog.rs).**
   Deferral is decided by `should_default_defer_tool` (`tool_catalog.rs:66-82`),
   and the active set is the head built by `build_model_tool_catalog`
   (`tool_catalog.rs:178-196`). Hidden-compat and deprecated tools must be
   forced *out of the active head* and *out of the tool-search-discoverable
   pool*. Concretely, the deferral predicate gains a short-circuit so these
   names are never active, and the tool-search index builder skips any name for
   which `is_hidden_or_deprecated(name)` is true. Arcee's narrowed first-turn
   path (`apply_provider_tool_policy`, `tool_catalog.rs:134-149`) already
   excludes them by construction since they aren't in
   `ARCEE_FIRST_TURN_NATIVE_TOOLS`.

2. **Result-notice append (tool_routing.rs).**
   Dispatch already routes by tool name in
   `crates/tui/src/tui/tool_routing.rs` (e.g. the wait/interact unification at
   `tool_routing.rs:1139-1140`). After a successful dispatch, if the called name
   is in `DEPRECATED_ALIASES`, the router appends the matching `note` to the
   **result metadata only**. Hidden-compat names append nothing.

### 3c. Why name-sets, not a per-`ToolSpec` enum field

A per-`ToolSpec` `lifecycle: Lifecycle` field was rejected for three reasons:

- **Prefix-cache safety.** The tool catalog array is part of DeepSeek's
  immutable KV prefix (`tool_catalog.rs:169-177`). A per-spec field invites
  serializing lifecycle state *into* each tool's schema, which is exactly the
  kind of head mutation that forces a full re-prefill. Name-sets live entirely
  in the catalog-build logic and never touch the emitted tool JSON.
- **Single source of truth + diffability.** The diet for a release is one small,
  reviewable edit to two or three const arrays in one file, instead of scattered
  field flips across many tool modules.
- **Registration stays orthogonal.** Tools remain registered exactly as today
  (e.g. `with_shell_tools`, `registry.rs:523-531`). Lifecycle is a *catalog
  policy* layered on top of registration, not a property baked into the tool.

---

## 4. Deprecation manifest (the #2681 acceptance-criteria table)

This was the proposed manifest. Columns are the #2681 AC columns. No entry was
"removed" in 0.8.53; replay was to be supported for everything listed.

> **Superseded in part.** `exec_wait` and `exec_interact` were removed
> (`shell_surface_exposes_lowercase_bash_and_hides_legacy_handler` in
> `crates/tui/src/tools/registry/tests.rs`); they are not callable. The
> work-progress rows are not uniformly removed. `todo_write` is the canonical
> model-visible `TodoWriteTool`; `ToolRegistryBuilder::with_todo_tool` also
> registers hidden replay aliases `work_update`, `TodoWrite`, `todo`,
> `checklist_write`, and `checklist_update`. `checklist_add`, `checklist_list`,
> `todo_add`, `todo_update`, and `todo_list` are not registered (engine tests
> assert they "must not be callable"). The `"must no longer be callable"`
> assertion in `registry/tests.rs` (`rlm_is_the_only_registered_session_surface`)
> applies to the old `rlm_*` session names, not to checklist/todo. `tts`
> remains dispatchable via `with_speech_tools`. The `replay_supported = Yes`
> column is true for `tts` and for the registered todo/checklist aliases; false
> for `exec_wait`/`exec_interact` and for the unregistered checklist/todo names.

| Alias | Replacement (canonical) | Lifecycle state | first_deprecated_version | planned_removal_version | replay_supported |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exec_wait` | `exec_shell_wait` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `exec_interact` | `exec_shell_interact` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `tts` | `speech` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `checklist_write` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.9.0 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `checklist_add` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.9.0 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `checklist_update` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.9.0 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `checklist_list` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.9.0 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `todo_write` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `todo_add` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `todo_update` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |
| `todo_list` | `todo_write` | hidden-compatibility | 0.8.53 | TBD (≥ 0.9.x) | Yes |

The `todo_*` aliases first entered hidden compatibility in v0.8.53. v0.9.0
changes their canonical replacement to `todo_write`; it does not reset their
first-deprecated version.

**Legacy subagent names — removed, no manifest entry needed.**
The model-visible subagent surface is only `agent`. The old lifecycle names and
the experimental tool-agent lane were removed rather than kept as hidden
compatibility tools.

`planned_removal_version` is intentionally `TBD`: a name only moves to **removed**
once we formally drop replay for transcripts old enough to contain it, which is a
separate, deliberate decision per name.

---

## 5. Active-catalog budget (per mode, per provider)

The active set is the first-turn cost. Do not duplicate the exact
`DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS` count here: adjacent PRs in the v0.8.53 batch may
add or remove active tools, and the source of truth is always
`tool_catalog.rs`. This document defines the diet policy and invariants, not a
second catalog snapshot.

### Per provider

| Provider | First-turn active source | Budget policy |
|---|---|---|
| Default (DeepSeek et al.) | `DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS` | Remove duplicate aliases from the active head when their canonical twins stay active; any net growth needs an explicit budget decision. |
| Arcee (Trinity) | `ARCEE_FIRST_TURN_NATIVE_TOOLS` | Provider-specific read-only WAF workaround; unchanged by the default diet unless explicitly reviewed. |

The default diet removes `exec_wait` and `exec_interact` from the active head
(they become hidden-compat; their canonical twins `exec_shell_wait` /
`exec_shell_interact` stay). `tts` and the legacy `todo_*` aliases remain out
of the active set. The canonical `todo_write` tool became eager in v0.9.6 as an
explicit budget decision so ordinary progress tracking never requires a
discovery turn.

### Per mode (Plan / Agent / YOLO)

The native active head is the **same set across modes** by design — mode does not
add or remove native tools from `DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS`
(`should_default_defer_tool` ignores `_mode` for native tools,
`tool_catalog.rs:66-68`). Mode affects **MCP** deferral instead:
`apply_mcp_tool_deferral` keeps MCP tools deferred unless `mode == Yolo`
(`tool_catalog.rs:162-167`).

| Mode | Native active budget | MCP tools active? |
|---|---|---|
| Plan | same native head | No (deferred) |
| Agent | same native head | No (deferred) |
| YOLO | same native head | Yes (a known, intentional widening) |

**Budget rule:** the native active head must stay byte-identical across Plan ↔
Agent ↔ YOLO (Section 8). Any growth of the head requires retiring something
else or an explicit budget bump in this doc.

---

## 6. The canonical-surface rule

> **Every model-visible (active or deferred-discoverable) tool must have one
> clear niche. If a tool is superseded, it gets a named replacement and moves to
> hidden-compatibility or deprecated — it does not stay visible.**

### Canonical vs compatibility summary for the confusing clusters

| Cluster | Canonical (keep visible) | Compatibility / retired | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shell wait** | `exec_shell_wait` | `exec_wait` → hidden-compat | Same `ShellWaitTool` (`registry.rs:526,529`); router already unifies (`tool_routing.rs:1139`) |
| **Shell interact** | `exec_shell_interact` | `exec_interact` → hidden-compat | Same `ShellInteractTool` (`registry.rs:527,530`) |
| **Work progress / checklist / todo** | `todo_write` | registered hidden-compat: `work_update`, `TodoWrite`, `todo`, `checklist_write`, `checklist_update`; not registered: `checklist_add`/`list`, `todo_add`/`update`/`list` | Same `TodoWriteTool`; registered aliases replay old transcripts only |
| **Speech / tts** | `speech` | `tts` → hidden-compat | Same `SpeechTool` (`registry.rs:787-792`) |
| **Subagent lifecycle** | `agent` | old lifecycle names and tool-agent lane removed | Single async launcher. (The "child agents are leaf workers" note here did not ship — see §7.) |
| **Edit family** | `apply_patch`, `edit_file`, `write_file`, `fim_edit` | none — **all distinct niches** | NOT touched (per #2681 non-goals); doc-only canonical guidance |
| **Search family** | `grep_files` (content), `file_search` (filename), `project_map` (structure) | none — **distinct niches** | NOT touched; no FTS5/BM25/semantic index exists today |

**Non-goals (explicitly NOT diet targets in this cycle, per #2681):**
`apply_patch` / `edit_file` / `write_file` / `fim_edit`;
`grep_files` / `file_search` / `project_map`;
`fetch_url` / `web.run` / `web_search`;
`task_shell_*`; `handle_read` / `retrieve_tool_result`. These have distinct
niches and receive **canonical guidance only** — no lifecycle change.

The RLM surface (`rlm_open` / `rlm_eval` / `rlm_configure` / `rlm_close` /
`rlm_session_objects`, `crates/tui/src/tools/rlm.rs`) is likewise out of scope;
`handle_read` retrieves var handles, and `finalize` / `FINAL` is an in-kernel
Python function, **not a tool** — so there is nothing to retire there.

---

## 7. Subagent cutover decision: one visible launcher

The old lifecycle trio and tool-agent lane are removed, not hidden compatibility
tools.

**Decision: expose only `agent`.**

- `agent` starts one focused background child and returns the agent id plus
  transcript handle.
- Child results arrive as completion events. The parent should keep working
  instead of polling a lifecycle tool.
- Child tool catalogs exclude the removed subagent *lifecycle* tools.
  (**Not as shipped:** this bullet originally continued "so children are leaf
  workers and cannot recursively summon more agents." That is not what landed.
  Children receive `agent` and can recurse to the configured depth — see
  `with_full_agent_surface_options` and `can_spawn_child` in
  `tools/subagent/mod.rs`, and [`SUBAGENTS.md`](SUBAGENTS.md).)
- Detailed inspection goes through `handle_read` on the returned transcript
  handle.

This is a lifecycle simplification, not a provider gate.

---

## 8. Prefix-cache safety + replay guarantee

### Prefix-cache rules every diet PR MUST follow

The tools array is part of DeepSeek's immutable KV prefix. The catalog-head
byte-stability invariant (`tool_catalog.rs:169-196`) is binding:

1. **Never mutate the active head non-deterministically.** The first-turn active
   block must be **byte-identical run-to-run** and across Plan ↔ Agent ↔ YOLO.
2. **A diet is a one-time deterministic edit.** Removing a name from
   `DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS` shifts the head exactly once; after that it must
   be stable. Land such edits as their own focused change.
3. **Notices live in result metadata, never the prefix.** Deprecated replacement
   notes are appended at dispatch time in `tool_routing.rs` to the *call result*
   only. **Nothing** about hidden/deprecated state may be serialized into a tool
   schema, description, or the catalog array.
4. **Preserve ordering and partitioning.** `build_model_tool_catalog` sorts each
   partition by name and keeps built-ins as a contiguous prefix ahead of MCP
   tools (`tool_catalog.rs:186-194`). Diet edits must not break this.
5. **Hidden/deprecated tools are excluded *before* the head is built**, so their
   removal is the only head change — they do not appear in the prefix at all.

### Old-transcript replay guarantee (not adopted)

The blanket guarantee below was proposed, not shipped as written. `exec_wait`
and `exec_interact` were removed and fail as unknown tools. Work-progress
replay is narrower: `todo_write` plus the hidden aliases registered by
`with_todo_tool` (`work_update`, `TodoWrite`, `todo`, `checklist_write`,
`checklist_update`) still dispatch; `checklist_add`, `checklist_list`,
`todo_add`, `todo_update`, and `todo_list` do not. `tts` remains
dispatchable. `apply_patch` is a separate replay-only edit alias; see
[`TOOL_SURFACE.md`](TOOL_SURFACE.md).

> For every name in the deprecation manifest with `replay_supported = Yes`, the
> tool stays **registered and dispatchable with identical behavior**. Replaying
> an old transcript that calls `exec_wait`, `exec_interact`, `tts`, or any
> `todo_*` produces the same result it always did. Deprecated names additionally
> attach a result-metadata notice; hidden-compat names are silent. A name is only
> ever made non-dispatchable (**removed**) after a deliberate, per-name decision
> to drop replay support at `planned_removal_version`.

---

## 9. Required tests

Any diet PR (and the umbrella #2681 work) must add/keep:

1. **Duplicate-active-alias guard.** A test asserting that no name in
   `HIDDEN_COMPATIBILITY_TOOLS` or `DEPRECATED_ALIASES` appears in
   `DEFAULT_ACTIVE_NATIVE_TOOLS` or `ARCEE_FIRST_TURN_NATIVE_TOOLS`, and that no
   two active entries resolve to the same underlying tool implementation.

2. **Tool-search exclusion test.** Assert that hidden-compat and deprecated names
   are absent from the tool-search-discoverable pool while remaining present in
   the registry (dispatchable).

3. **Replay / dispatch tests.** For each manifest name, calling it still
   executes and returns the same result as its canonical twin. Deprecated names
   additionally assert the replacement note is present **in result metadata** and
   absent from the catalog/prefix. Hidden-compat names assert **no** added
   notice.

4. **Golden active-block byte test.** A snapshot test pinning the byte
   serialization of the first-turn active tool block, asserting it is identical
   across Plan / Agent / YOLO (native head) and stable run-to-run — enforcing the
   `tool_catalog.rs:169-196` invariant. The golden updates **only** as a
   reviewed, deliberate one-time edit when the diet lands.

5. **Subagent guardrail test.** Assert only `agent` is registered as a
   model-visible subagent tool and that hidden/legacy names from
   `subagent/mod.rs` are not advertised.

6. **Leaf-worker test.** Assert subagent tool catalogs exclude `agent` and
   retired legacy lifecycle names.

# `read_media` Operator Guide

`read_media` is a safe, first-class image reading and preprocessing tool for Codewhale v0.9.10. It allows vision-capable coding models to inspect visual assets (diagrams, UI mockups, screenshots, rendered graphs) with strict security, memory bounds, and privacy guards.

---

## 1. Overview and Scope

- **Supported Formats:** PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP.
- **Out of Scope:** Video files, audio streams, and background/automatic screenshot watching are deliberately excluded.
- **Provider-Neutral Wiring:** Decoded and normalized images are converted into native image parts across all supported providers (OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and OpenAI Responses API).

### Show the agent a screenshot

- Paste a clipboard image into the composer with the normal terminal paste
  shortcut, or run `/attach <path>` for an existing PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP.
- A visible attachment row appears above the composer before the turn is sent.
  Temporary macOS `NSIRD_screencaptureui` paths are copied into Codewhale's
  stable attachment store when ingested.
- Ask the agent to inspect the screenshot. The image is sent only as part of
  that explicit turn action; merely having a screenshot path or artifact does
  not trigger background analysis.

`read_media` is the corresponding agent-side path for inspecting another
image later in the task without requiring the operator to attach it again.

## 2. Activation and Catalog Policy

- **Default-Off / Deferred Loading:** To preserve model context budgets, `read_media` is registered as a deferred tool (`defer_loading = true`) rather than occupying active slots in the default core catalog.
- **Explicit Model Invocation:** The tool is invoked explicitly by name when the model or user requests media inspection.
- **Eager Configuration:** Operators who want `read_media` always pre-loaded in the model tool catalog can configure:

```toml
[tools]
always_load = ["read_media"]
```

## 3. Tool Parameters and Schema

```json
{
  "path": "docs/architecture.png",
  "crop": {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 50,
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
  },
  "detail": "auto"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | **Yes** | Workspace-relative or trusted external path to the image file. |
| `crop` | object | No | Optional pixel bounding box `{ "x": u32, "y": u32, "width": u32, "height": u32 }` (0-indexed). |
| `detail` | string | No | Resolution target: `"auto"` (max 2048px, default), `"low"` (max 1024px), `"high"` / `"original"` (up to 4096px). |

## 4. Safety, Privacy, and Guardrails

### 4.1. Workspace Boundary and Credential Protection
- **Workspace Containment:** Paths must resolve within the workspace or user-approved trusted external paths (`/trust`). Symlink escapes outside trusted roots are rejected.
- **Credential Protection:** Codewhale configuration (`config.toml`, `.codewhale/`, `.deepseek/`, secrets directory) cannot be read via `read_media` and will fail with `PermissionDenied`.

### 4.2. Decompression-Bomb and Memory Limits
- **Source Byte Limit:** Maximum source file size before decoding is **20 MiB** (`MAX_SOURCE_IMAGE_BYTES`). Oversized files are rejected before allocation.
- **Dimension Guards:** Maximum permitted image width and height is **8192 px** (`MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION`).
- **Pixel Budget:** Maximum total pixel count is **33,554,432 pixels** (~33.5 megapixels, `MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`).
- **Memory Ceiling:** Safe memory allocation during decode is capped at **64 MiB** (`MAX_DECODE_ALLOC_BYTES`).
- **Wire Payload Limit:** Re-encoded image payload is capped at **5 MiB** (`MAX_WIRE_IMAGE_BYTES`), matching provider constraints.

### 4.3. Active Route Vision Checks
- Before reading an image, `read_media` inspects `context.route_capabilities.image_input`.
- If the active model route explicitly lacks vision support (`CapabilityState::Unsupported`), the tool returns an actionable error directing the operator to switch to a vision model:

```text
read_media: the active model route does not support image input. Switch to a route marked vision-capable with /model, or configure the route's image_input capability, then try again.
```

Only a known `Unsupported` capability blocks the explicit tool call. An
`Unknown` capability is admitted deliberately, matching normal attachment
routing: custom and self-hosted providers often do not publish modality
metadata, so their provider response remains authoritative. Operators who
need a fail-closed route can set its `image_input` capability explicitly.

## 5. Typed Receipts and Wire Integration

Each successful execution yields:
1. **Human-Readable Receipt (`content`):** Summarizes original format, source and final dimensions, crop details, and byte sizes.
2. **Typed JSON Metadata (`metadata`):** Contains structured dimension, crop, and byte information without exposing credentials or internal tokens.
3. **Rich Image Content Block (`content_blocks`):** Attaches a standardized `ToolResultContentBlock::Image` which provider adapters wire into outbound requests:
   - **OpenAI Chat Completions:** `image_url` block in following user message.
   - **Anthropic Messages:** `image` base64 source inside `tool_result` block.
   - **OpenAI Responses:** `input_image` block inside function call output.

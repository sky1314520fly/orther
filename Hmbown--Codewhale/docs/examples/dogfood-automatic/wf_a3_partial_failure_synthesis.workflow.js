/**
 * #4131 WF-A3 — partial failure + synthesis.
 *
 * parallel() uses all-settled semantics: a failed slot becomes null; the run
 * continues so a synthesizer can still produce an operator summary. The slot
 * is null but not anonymous — `slots.errors` carries `{ index, kind, message }`
 * for every drop, so the summary can name what was lost instead of guessing.
 *
 * Run: /workflow run docs/examples/dogfood-automatic/wf_a3_partial_failure_synthesis.workflow.js
 *
 * For pure VM proof without model spend, use workflow-js unit tests:
 *   cargo test -p codewhale-workflow-js --locked parallel_fan_out_maps_one_failure_to_null_slot

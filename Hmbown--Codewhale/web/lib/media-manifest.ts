/**
 * media-manifest.ts — the real-session media surface for codewhale.net.
 *
 * Every real-session asset the site may show is declared here, with its
 * poster, captions, transcript, GIF fallback, and budgets. The manifest is
 * the contract: `web/components/session-media.tsx` renders whatever is
 * declared, and `web/lib/media-manifest.test.ts` enforces the rules below.
 *
 * THE HONESTY CONTRACT:
 *   - A `pending` entry declares intent only. It has NO asset fields, and no
 *     files may exist for it under `web/public/media/`. The component renders
 *     a visible "recording pending release candidate" state — never a mock,
 *     staged, or recycled clip. (Release issue #4906: the dogfood recording
 *     happens after the v0.9.2 candidate is stable.)
 *   - A `published` entry is complete or it does not ship: poster, video,
 *     per-locale captions (WebVTT), a transcript, and a GIF fallback are all
 *     required. Tests verify presence and byte budgets, inspect PNG poster
 *     dimensions, and compare declared video metadata with MEDIA_BUDGETS.
 *     Actual video duration/dimensions remain a recording-checklist gate.
 *   - Reduced motion is structural, not a media query patch: the video never
 *     autoplays (`preload="none"`, user-initiated only), the poster is the
 *     static default, and the GIF fallback link is always visible.
 *
 * The exact post-dogfood recording procedure lives in
 * docs/releases/v0.9.2-media-plan.md. Flip an entry to `published` only by
 * following that checklist.

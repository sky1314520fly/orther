    "Codewhale gives the agent an accountable address, then a legal system for context conflicts. {constitutionCommand} is the primary personal constitution surface: guided setup stores structured user-global data in {homeConfig} and renders it as model-facing prose. Repos can still add local law via {repoConfig}; runtime policy separately encodes modes, approval, sandbox, cost, and tool boundaries.",

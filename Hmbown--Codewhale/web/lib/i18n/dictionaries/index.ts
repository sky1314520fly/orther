/**
 * Dictionary loader for the website localization layer (#3091, #4934).
 *
 * Lookup is deterministic: a routed locale with a dictionary gets its own
 * copy; every other locale gets the English reference dictionary. There is
 * no per-key fallback chain — each shipped/partial dictionary is held to
 * exact key parity with English by `web/scripts/check-locales.mjs` and
 * `dictionaries.test.ts`, so a missing key is a build-time failure, never
 * a runtime "missing marker".
 *
 * English resolves through the `?? enChrome` / `?? enHome` fallback rather
 * than a map entry, which keeps `DICTIONARY_LOCALES` equal to the set of
 * non-reference locale directories that `check-locales.mjs` walks.

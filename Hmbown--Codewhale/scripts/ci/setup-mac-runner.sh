# Register this Mac as a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for the macOS legs.
#
# WHY: GitHub's hosted macOS queue routinely takes 50+ minutes, which is the
# single slowest gate on every PR. This machine finishes the same work in a
# fraction of that.
#
# SAFETY — read this before running it.
#
# Hmbown/CodeWhale is a PUBLIC repository with thousands of forks. A
# self-hosted runner that accepts pull requests from forks lets anyone who
# opens a PR execute arbitrary code on this machine, as this user. That is the
# one CI configuration GitHub explicitly warns against, and on this machine it
# would expose ~/.codewhale/secrets.json, the gh token, and the whole CW
# workspace.
#
# The companion change in .github/workflows/ci.yml therefore routes jobs to
# this runner ONLY for same-repository events (pushes and PRs whose head repo
# is Hmbown/CodeWhale). Fork PRs keep running on GitHub-hosted runners. Do not
# remove that guard; without it this script is a remote-code-execution hole.
#
# Each job gets a freshly registered --ephemeral runner: the registration is
# consumed by one job and then discarded, so a job cannot persist a runner
# registration for later use. Note this is NOT filesystem isolation — an
# ephemeral runner still runs as this user on this disk. For real isolation,
# run this inside a throwaway VM (Tart, UTM, or a dedicated macOS user with no
# access to the secrets above).
#
# Usage:  scripts/ci/setup-mac-runner.sh [--once]
# Requires: gh, authenticated with admin rights on the repo.

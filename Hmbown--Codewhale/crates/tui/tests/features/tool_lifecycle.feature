Feature: Tool call lifecycle
  Scenario: Happy path lists the current directory through a tool
    # This executable slice asserts the public exec stream and mocked LLM border.
    # Visible Work, status, tool-card, and transcript behavior is inspected in
    # the actual terminal when that product surface changes.
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path      | kind   |
      | README.md | file   |
      | notes.txt | file   |
      | src       | folder |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "File" tool with:
      | action | path |
      | list   | .    |
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                                                    |
      | The directory contains README.md, notes.txt, and src/.      |
    When the user asks "list the current directory"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool:
      | status  | marker | tool | action | input |
      | running | [~]    | File | list   | .     |
    And the public tool result should return directory entries:
      | entry     | kind   |
      | README.md | file   |
      | notes.txt | file   |
      | src       | folder |
    And CodeWhale should send the tool result back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a completed tool:
      | status    | marker | tool | action | input |
      | completed | ✓      | File | list   | .     |
    And the public output should include "The directory contains README.md, notes.txt, and src/."

  Scenario: Unknown tool returns an error result
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path      | kind |
      | README.md | file |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "missing_tool" tool with:
      | path |
      | .    |
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                                      |
      | I could not run the requested missing tool. |
    When the user asks "try a missing tool"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool:
      | status  | marker | tool         | input |
      | running | [~]    | missing_tool | .     |
    And the public tool result should report an error for "missing_tool"
    And CodeWhale should send the tool error back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a failed tool:
      | status | marker | tool         | input |
      | error  | [!]    | missing_tool | .     |
    And the public output should include "I could not run the requested missing tool."

  Scenario: Malformed tool arguments return an error result
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path      | kind |
      | README.md | file |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "File" tool with malformed arguments "{not-json"
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                                 |
      | I could not parse the tool arguments. |
    When the user asks "try malformed tool arguments"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool with raw input for "File"
    And the public tool result should report malformed arguments for "File"
    And CodeWhale should send the malformed argument error back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a failed tool with raw input for "File"
    And the public output should include "I could not parse the tool arguments."

  Scenario: A real tool error is returned to the follow-up request
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path      | kind |
      | README.md | file |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "File" tool with:
      | action | path        |
      | read   | missing.txt |
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                                                  |
      | I could not read missing.txt because the file is absent. |
    When the user asks "read the missing file"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool:
      | status  | marker | tool | action | input       |
      | running | [~]    | File | read   | missing.txt |
    And the public tool result should report a real error for "File" containing "missing.txt"
    And CodeWhale should send the real tool error back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a failed tool:
      | status | marker | tool | action | input       |
      | error  | [!]    | File | read   | missing.txt |
    And the public output should include "I could not read missing.txt because the file is absent."

  Scenario: An empty tool result is returned to the follow-up request
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path  | kind   |
      | empty | folder |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "File" tool with:
      | action | path  |
      | list   | empty |
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                           |
      | The directory is currently empty. |
    When the user asks "list the empty directory"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool:
      | status  | marker | tool | action | input |
      | running | [~]    | File | list   | empty |
    And the public tool result should be an empty list
    And CodeWhale should send the empty tool result back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a completed tool:
      | status    | marker | tool | action | input |
      | completed | ✓      | File | list   | empty |
    And the public output should include "The directory is currently empty."

  Scenario: A follow-up answer missing the expected summary is detected
    Given an offline CodeWhale workspace containing:
      | path      | kind |
      | README.md | file |
    And the mocked LLM will request the "File" tool with:
      | action | path |
      | list   | .    |
    And the mocked LLM will answer after the tool result:
      | content                    |
      | I inspected the workspace. |
    When the user asks "summarize the current directory"
    Then CodeWhale should send the user request to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a running tool:
      | status  | marker | tool | action | input |
      | running | [~]    | File | list   | .     |
    And the public tool result should return directory entries:
      | entry     | kind |
      | README.md | file |
    And CodeWhale should send the tool result back to the mocked LLM
    And the public tool lifecycle should show a completed tool:
      | status    | marker | tool | action | input |
      | completed | ✓      | File | list   | .     |
    And the public output should include "I inspected the workspace."
    But acceptance should report the missing expected summary "The directory contains README.md."

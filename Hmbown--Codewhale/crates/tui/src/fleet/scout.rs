//! Scout — the one visible fast exploratory role.
//!
//! Scout is exploration, triage, and quick research. There is exactly one
//! concept; the legacy `faster`/`model_strength` control is removed from the
//! user-facing surface (its parsing survives for compatibility and maps onto
//! the Scout policy).
//!
//! Route resolution, in order:
//!
//! 1. **An explicit Scout pin always wins** and survives operator changes.
//! 2. **No pin:** a suggested fast companion from explicit catalog metadata —
//!    the provider's documented cheap sibling via
//!    [`crate::model_routing::provider_router_candidates`] (DeepSeek
//!    pro/flash, Z.ai 5.2/5.3 → GLM-5-Turbo, Claude → Haiku, …). The
//!    suggestion is honored only when that model actually exists in the
//!    merged catalog for the provider — never invented.
//! 3. **No verified companion:** the Scout inherits the session route
//!    deliberately, and the resolution says so.
//! 4. **No session route at all:** `Unavailable` with a precise reason.

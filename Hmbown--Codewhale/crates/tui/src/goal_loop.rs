//! Goal loop orchestrator — the persistent-objective control layer (#3215, and
//! its lineage #891 / #1976 / #2058 / #2029).
//!
//! This is the **Workflow goal layer**: the decision core that turns a one-shot
//! `/goal` into a persistent work loop. Given the durable goal status, the
//! accumulated usage (from the per-goal accounting wired in `crates/state`
//! `record_thread_goal_usage`), and a budget, it decides whether to **continue**
//! (re-dispatch another worker turn toward the objective) or **stop** with a
//! terminal status. It is the orchestrator in the Workflow≈ultracode mapping —
//! the loop that fans work out to workers (`worker_profile`) and verifies before
//! committing.
//!
//! Scope: **decision logic + types**. The engine (`core/engine.rs`) reads the
//! `SharedGoalState` snapshot after each turn and calls `decide_continuation`
//! to decide whether to re-dispatch. For operate-mode goals the only terminal
//! stops are a verified completion, a blocked report, or the continuation
//! backstop (`[goal] max_continuations`); token/time accounting stays visible
//! as telemetry but does not gate continuation — the run is unbounded like
//! grokbuild (`DEFAULT_AGENT_BUDGET` as call cap) and kimicode swarm
//! (`turnBudget` per-task, resumable after budget-reached). Log when the
//! backstop fires.

//! Token / cache / cost scorecard (#3388).
//!
//! A release-gate view of an agent run's token economics: per-turn input /
//! output / cache-read tokens and cost, aggregate totals + cache-hit ratio, and
//! regression detection against a committed baseline. This is the measurement
//! layer the "token, cache, and context discipline" EPIC asks for — it makes a
//! cost/token regression visible instead of silently shipping.
//!
//! The core here is pure and offline: it turns already-recorded per-turn
//! [`Usage`] (captured on every turn, persisted in `TurnRecord`) into a
//! scorecard, reusing the existing pricing layer rather than reinventing cost
//! math. The `scorecard` subcommand is a thin I/O wrapper over this module.

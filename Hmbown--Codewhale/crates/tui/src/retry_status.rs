//! Process-wide retry-state surface (#499).
//!
//! Read-side caveat (0.9.4): the renderer this module was written for was
//! the legacy footer's retry banner, which went with `FooterWidget`. The
//! *producer* — `client::send_with_retry` — is still live and still records
//! every retry, and `client`'s own tests read it back through [`snapshot`].
//! The read surface below therefore carries `#[allow(dead_code)]` rather
//! than being deleted: removing it would mean changing `start`/`failed`'s
//! signatures at their live call sites in `client.rs`. Give the banner a
//! renderer, or delete the producer too — but not half of it.
//!
//! The HTTP retry path in `client::send_with_retry` already times its
//! waits and knows the error category. This module gives the TUI a way
//! to observe that state — `start`, `succeeded`, and `failed` flip a
//! global `RetryState` that the footer / status panel reads each frame.
//!
//! Why a process-wide global: the user-facing TUI runs as one engine
//! per process, and the only retry state we want to surface is the one
//! the user is staring at. Sub-agent retries in background tasks
//! deliberately do **not** light up the foreground banner — they're
//! supposed to be invisible. If a future feature ever needs per-engine
//! retry surfaces, swap this for an `Arc<RwLock<...>>` carried on the
//! `EngineHandle`; the public API stays the same.

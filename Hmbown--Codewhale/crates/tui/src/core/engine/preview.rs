//! Engine-side authority for `/preview-request` (#1004, #3928).
//!
//! The preview lives here — not in the command layer — because only the
//! engine can rebuild the *exact* next-turn state: the tool catalog under the
//! live mode, gates, permission posture and connected MCP tools; the system
//! prompt for the route the next turn would use; the hypothetical next user
//! message in its production form; and the request the turn loop would hand
//! to `create_message_stream`.
//!
//! Four rules this module exists to enforce:
//!
//! - **Never `session.last_tool_catalog`.** That value is one turn stale and
//!   stores the pre-activation catalog, so it cannot describe what the *next*
//!   request would send. The catalog is rebuilt through
//!   [`Engine::build_turn_tool_registry_and_catalog`], which returns the same
//!   typed policy a real turn consumes.
//! - **Never invent a route.** For fixed routes, the host resolves the next
//!   turn through the same shared planner production dispatch uses. Auto would
//!   require a model-classifier call, so the human preview stops before the
//!   planner and emits a typed unavailable state. No route, endpoint, wire
//!   model, billing, tool budget, or body hash is recycled from the installed
//!   route.
//! - **Never resolve by side effect.** The catalog build runs with
//!   [`SubAgentWiring::Inert`] and [`McpAccess::PassiveSnapshot`]: no fork
//!   snapshot, no spawned drainer, no MCP pool creation, no `connect_all`, no
//!   status events. When the connected MCP state is not already exactly what
//!   a turn would use, the tool section is reported unavailable rather than
//!   made exact by connecting — **and so is the body**, because a body built
//!   from a tool surface missing its MCP contribution is a body no turn would
//!   send.
//! - **Never install anything, not even briefly.** The planned route is
//!   projected into a throw-away client; `self.api_provider`,
//!   `self.session.model`, `self.session.system_prompt`, and the MCP pool are
//!   all left untouched. Everything a turn would *install before* building its
//!   request — the command-scoped tool gate, the effective mode and approval
//!   posture, the policy-narrowing event, the observed working set — is passed
//!   as a value or snapshotted onto a clone. There is no write-then-restore
//!   anywhere in this module: a restore is not atomic across an `.await`, and
//!   it does not survive a cancellation or a panic.
//! - **Never claim exactness the runtime would break.** Mutable
//!   `message_submit` hooks, background-shell completions, running or
//!   terminal-undelivered sub-agent completions,
//!   pending LSP diagnostics, auto-compaction, and context-overflow recovery
//!   all rewrite the request between submit and the wire. An inspection may
//!   neither run them nor consume them, so when any of them apply the affected
//!   sections are typed unavailable instead of published.
//!
//! Scope: this describes the primary agent turn (`create_message_stream`).
//! Auxiliary provider calls are out of scope; see `docs/PREVIEW_REQUEST.md`.
//!
//! The `dryrun` concept — preview the next request from the real
//! request-building seam rather than a hand-rolled summary — is harvested
//! from PR #1099 by TaoMu (GTC2080).

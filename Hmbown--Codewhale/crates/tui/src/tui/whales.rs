//! Whale Teams — the Signal Cut whale identities in the terminal.
//!
//! CWC's "Whale Teams / Signal Cut" identity (2026-08-15) gives each agent
//! role a species-led whale and every whale one of six runtime states. This
//! module carries that identity into the TUI as species badges and state
//! words. The hand-drawn portrait art that used to live here (the three-row
//! glyph renditions and the hand-drawn crown fluke) was deleted per the
//! 2026-08-29 founder directive; the only sanctioned terminal mark is the one
//! generated from the brand master path. Colors are Codewhale palette tokens
//! resolved through the live [`UiTheme`], so the whales follow Blue Stage
//! dark/light, the Terminal theme, and ANSI-16 adaptation like every other
//! surface.
//!
//! Contract:
//! - **Role → species is one table** ([`WhaleSpecies::for_role_id`]). Fleet
//!   roles map onto the six species; roles without a species (`worker`,
//!   `general`, `custom`, unknown) render the plain Codewhale whale.
//! - **State is evidence, never decoration.** [`WhaleState`] is derived only
//!   from real runtime facts ([`WhaleState::for_subagent`],
//!   [`WhaleState::for_shell_phase`]). *Working* is asserted only for a child
//!   or turn that is actually running.
//! - **Every state pairs a glyph cue with a word** ([`WhaleState::word`]), so
//!   state never depends on color alone (same rule as `menu_style`).
//! - **ASCII-safe by construction.** Every authored glyph has a
//!   [`glyphs::ascii_fallback`] entry, and [`badge_ascii`] exposes the
//!   narrowed badge for tests and text surfaces.
//!
//! Only the *signal-classic* colorway is represented. The three alternate CWC
//! colorways exist only as resting rasters upstream and are not modelled here.

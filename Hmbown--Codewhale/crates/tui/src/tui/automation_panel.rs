//! Live scheduled-work projection for the activity band
//! (AUTOMATION-VISIBILITY-SPEC §2.1).
//!
//! One owner per fact: this projection is the single reader of "how much
//! scheduled work is live" — Active automations (`N`), runs currently
//! Queued|Running (`M`), and failed runs not yet acknowledged. The top
//! strip reads it; `background_indicator.rs` keeps owning
//! shells/tasks/agents and never learns about automations.
//!
//! The disk scan lives in `tui/ui/task_projection.rs`
//! (`refresh_automation_panel`): taken on a blocking thread, folded on the
//! same ~2.5 s cadence as the task panel. Everything here is a pure,
//! testable fold over that scan.
//!
//! The fold also detects the one transition Slice 1 can observe without an
//! engine change: a run this session watched go live and then settle.
//! Each such run is reported once (`ScanDelta::settled`) so the projection's
//! owner can post the typed `completed in background` / `failed` receipt
//! (spec §2.2) — the transcript learns about background work from the same
//! scan that lights the band, never from a second reader.

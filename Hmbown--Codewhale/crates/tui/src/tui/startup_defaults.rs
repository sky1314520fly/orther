//! The single owner for startup defaults written back by interactive TUI
//! selectors.
//!
//! Before this module there were three unrelated writers for the same
//! `settings.toml` keys: the model picker's combined model+effort apply, the
//! effort-only picker apply, and — for `default_mode` — nothing at all, so
//! cycling into Operate reverted to Act on the next launch while the preset
//! and `/config` surfaces persisted correctly. Routing every interactive
//! selector through [`StartupDefaults`] keeps one load/normalize/save
//! transaction per user action and one place where the write can be audited.
//!
//! Every write goes through one per-`App` owner, [`StartupDefaultsWriter`],
//! which is what makes the two application shapes safe to mix:
//!
//! - [`StartupDefaultsWriter::apply_blocking`] is synchronous. The model picker
//!   uses it because it must know whether the write landed before it records a
//!   provider/model setup receipt.
//! - [`StartupDefaultsWriter::spawn`] is non-blocking. Mode cycling and
//!   reasoning cycling are keystroke-rate actions, so they must never gate a
//!   redraw on disk I/O. Failures are still truthful: they land in a
//!   [`StartupDefaultFailures`] mailbox that the event loop drains into a
//!   warning toast, rather than being swallowed.
//!
//! ## Why the ordering is not left to the scheduler
//!
//! Each write is a load / modify / save transaction against one
//! `settings.toml`. Handing each keystroke its own blocking task lets two of
//! those transactions interleave — both load the same bytes, and the one that
//! saves last wins regardless of which selection the user made last. That loses
//! the newer selection for the same field, and it can also resurrect a stale
//! value for a *different* field, because each save writes the whole file.
//!
//! So ordering comes from the enqueue, never from task scheduling:
//!
//! 1. Every producer is the TUI event loop thread, which processes user actions
//!    one at a time. `spawn` pushes onto a FIFO queue *synchronously* on that
//!    thread, so queue order is exactly user-action order.
//! 2. A single `write` mutex is held across a whole drain — pop, load, modify,
//!    save, repeat — so no two transactions ever overlap, no matter how many
//!    blocking tasks are in flight. Extra tasks simply find the queue empty.
//! 3. `apply_blocking` takes the same mutex and first drains everything queued
//!    ahead of it, then applies its own update. It cannot be overtaken by a
//!    later action, because a later action can only be enqueued by the event
//!    loop thread that is currently blocked inside this call.
//!
//! Together: last user action wins for a field, and because each transaction
//! only sets the fields its own [`StartupDefaults`] carries, disjoint fields
//! never clobber each other.
//!
//! ## Why this writer is not the whole story
//!
//! The `write` mutex above only serializes transactions *this writer* owns, and
//! `settings.toml` has other writers in the same process — most sharply, the
//! Shift+Tab permission-posture write on the same event loop. Two writers that
//! each do their own load / modify / save can still lose a field to each other,
//! and locking `save` would not help because the stale read already happened.
//!
//! So the atomicity of a single load/modify/save belongs one level down, in
//! [`Settings::transact`], which holds a per-settings-path process mutex *and*
//! a cross-process advisory lock on an adjacent `settings.toml.lock` across the
//! whole cycle — the second one because a user can easily have two Codewhale
//! processes open on the same home directory. Every reachable settings writer
//! goes through it. What stays here is the part `transact` cannot provide:
//! **ordering**. A lock makes concurrent transactions safe but says nothing
//! about which one runs first, and for keystroke-rate actions "last user action
//! wins" is the behavior users can actually perceive.
//!
//! ## The no-deadlock contract
//!
//! `write` is held across disk I/O, so it is the *outermost* lock of every
//! transaction. `queue` is only ever taken for a single push or pop and never
//! across I/O, so it can never be the lock someone waits behind. That gives one
//! rule, and it is the rule this module has to keep true:
//!
//! > **No thread may block on `write` while holding a lock that a settings
//! > transaction needs.** Doing so parks the drainer (which holds `write` and
//! > wants that lock) against the waiter (which holds that lock and wants
//! > `write`).
//!
//! In production nothing violates it: a settings transaction takes only its own
//! two locks (the settings process mutex and the settings file lock), and
//! nothing that holds either ever asks for `write`. Under `cfg(test)` a third
//! lock joins the order — settings path
//! resolution goes through `test_support::with_test_env_lock`, and a
//! sealed-`HOME` test holds that lock for its entire body. So a test thread
//! calling [`StartupDefaultsWriter::flush`] or
//! [`StartupDefaultsWriter::apply_blocking`] would wait on a background drainer
//! that is itself parked on the test's own env lock. That inversion is the
//! deadlock this module was first shipped with.
//!
//! [`StartupDefaultsWriter::spawn`] closes it at the source, in two parts:
//!
//! 1. The background drain is enrolled in the *spawning test's* env scope
//!    (`test_support::join_env_scope`), so the drain never blocks on a lock its
//!    own test holds. The env barrier still applies to genuinely foreign
//!    readers; it just stops treating this test's own writer thread as one of
//!    them.
//! 2. Permission to write at all is keyed to a specific env-scope generation
//!    (see `spawn_writes_permitted`), not to a process-global flag. A test
//!    that is not inside an authorized scope enqueues nothing and spawns
//!    nothing, so it can never become a thread that holds `write` while parked
//!    on a *foreign* test's env lock. Outstanding-drain accounting is keyed the
//!    same way, so a closing gate only ever waits for the drains it authorized.
//!
//! `lock_write` and `Settings::transact` additionally carry test-only deadlines,
//! so if the rule is ever broken again the offending test fails with a
//! diagnostic instead of hanging CI.
//!
//! What this module does *not* own: the effective per-turn policy. Session
//! restore and preset application call `App::set_mode` directly, which changes
//! the live session only. Only a user-facing selection writes a startup
//! default.

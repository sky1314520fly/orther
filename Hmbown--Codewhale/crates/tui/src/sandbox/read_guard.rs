//! Read deny-list (S1, #5568 follow-up).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Every sandbox posture Codewhale ships — including `read-only` — grants the
//! sandboxed process read access to the entire filesystem
//! (`policy.rs::has_full_disk_read_access`). #5568 added the *plumbing* for an
//! opt-in deny-list (Seatbelt last-match-wins `deny file-read*` rules;
//! bubblewrap masks), but the list shipped empty, so in practice nothing was
//! denied. This module supplies (a) a curated default set covering the obvious
//! credential stores and (b) the in-process matcher that Codewhale's own
//! file-reading tools consult — those tools call `std::fs` directly inside the
//! harness process and are never wrapped by `sandbox-exec` or `bwrap` at all,
//! so the OS-level rules alone left the largest hole wide open.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! **This is defense-in-depth, not a security boundary.** It raises the cost of
//! a confused or prompt-injected agent stumbling into `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`; it
//! does not contain a deliberate attacker. Specifically it does NOT stop:
//!
//! - **Hardlinks.** A hardlink is a second *name* for the same inode with no
//!   trace of the first. `foo` hardlinked to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` canonicalizes to
//!   `foo`, matches nothing, and is read. No path-based deny-list can fix this;
//!   only an inode-level or MAC-label check could.
//! - **Content already elsewhere.** A key copied into the workspace before the
//!   agent ran, or pasted into the conversation, is readable.
//! - **Indirect reads.** `ssh-agent`, `security find-generic-password`,
//!   `aws sts get-session-token`, a helper the user installed — a process that
//!   *hands over* a secret without the agent reading the file. On macOS
//!   `~/Library/Keychains` is denied but the keychain *daemon* is not.
//! - **`danger-full-access`.** That posture bypasses the OS wrapper entirely
//!   (`should_sandbox() == false`). The in-process tool checks still apply, but
//!   a shell command does not.
//! - **Anything on the network side.** A denied read does not stop exfiltration
//!   of what *was* read.
//! - **Reads by MCP servers and other child processes** that Codewhale did not
//!   itself wrap.
//!
//! Treat it as a seatbelt, and keep the real controls (least-privilege
//! credentials, short-lived tokens, approval prompts) doing the real work.
//!
//! # Matching rules
//!
//! - **Deny wins.** A path matching any deny rule is refused; there is no allow
//!   rule that can override one. Exemptions (`sandbox_read_denylist_exempt`)
//!   subtract from the *built-in defaults* only, before matching — a path the
//!   user explicitly listed in `sandbox_denied_read_paths` can never be
//!   exempted back open.
//! - **Symlinks.** Both the literal path and its `canonicalize()`d target are
//!   tested, so a symlink pointing into `~/.ssh` is denied by its target even
//!   though its own name is innocuous. The *rules* are resolved the same way
//!   when they are built: a rule spelled `/etc/ssh` also denies
//!   `/private/etc/ssh` on macOS, where `/etc` is itself a symlink, and a rule
//!   written against a `/var/...` directory fires for the `/private/var/...`
//!   spelling that `canonicalize` and `current_dir` hand back. Without that,
//!   the resolved candidate never matched a literal rule, which is exactly the
//!   shape hosted macOS CI runs in (`$TMPDIR` under `/var/folders`).
//!   Exemptions are matched the same way, so exempting `/private/etc/sudoers`
//!   — the spelling a denial message may name — reopens the `/etc/sudoers`
//!   rule it resolves from. Rules are resolved when the list is built
//!   (startup and config reload); a symlink retargeted afterwards is seen
//!   through the literal candidate only until the list is rebuilt, which is
//!   within the defense-in-depth posture above.
//! - **`..` and relative paths.** Two candidates are tested. The literal one is
//!   lexically normalized (`.`/`..` folded without touching the disk), which
//!   catches traversal into a denied tree even when nothing on the path exists
//!   yet. The resolved one keeps `..` components raw and lets the OS apply
//!   them *after* resolving each symlink component — the secure order — because
//!   with `pub/link -> denied/sub`, the path `pub/link/../secret` really reads
//!   `denied/secret`; folding `..` first would hide that. When the path does
//!   not exist, the deepest existing ancestor is canonicalized (with the same
//!   raw order) and the remainder re-appended.
//! - **Case.** On macOS and Windows — where the default filesystem is
//!   case-insensitive — comparison is case-folded, so `~/.SSH/ID_RSA` is denied.
//!   On Linux comparison is exact, matching the filesystem's own semantics.
//! - **Boundaries are component-wise.** `~/.awsome/notes.md` is not under
//!   `~/.aws`; a plain string `starts_with` would have said it was.

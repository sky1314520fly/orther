//! Redacted request manifest for `/preview-request` (#1004, #3928).
//!
//! A [`RequestManifest`] describes the request the **next primary agent turn**
//! would send: dialect, endpoint identity, wire model, reasoning resolution,
//! the exact active tool catalog, sizes, conservative offline token estimates,
//! and a whole-body hash.
//!
//! Four properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Single-sourced.** Every wire fact is read off a
//!    [`PreparedOutboundRequest`] — the same value the transport sends. There
//!    is no second body builder, no Chat-shaped projection of a non-Chat
//!    route, and no re-derivation of prompt or tool selection here.
//! 2. **Typed, allowlisted disclosure.** The manifest is a fixed set of
//!    counts, hashes, enums, and short provenance labels, and every free-form
//!    string crosses [`crate::safe_label`] first. Prompt text, project
//!    instructions, memory, skill bodies, tool results, message content,
//!    credentials, URL paths, and absolute workspace paths have no field to
//!    occupy — and a hostile model or route id gets a fingerprint instead of
//!    a verbatim copy.
//! 3. **Whole-body fidelity.** The body hash covers the complete canonicalized
//!    wire body, so max-token fields, tool choice, nested reasoning controls,
//!    transformed tool schemas, attachments, and stream options all move it.
//! 4. **Structural honesty.** Facts that are not yet knowable are *absent*,
//!    not guessed. When auto model routing has not been resolved there is no
//!    provider, route id, dialect, endpoint, wire model, billing, tool budget,
//!    or body hash in this structure at all — a typed
//!    [`Unavailable`] stands in its place on both the human and the JSON
//!    surface. Recycling the current or previous route would be a lie about
//!    what the next request will contain.
//!
//! Scope: this describes the **primary `LlmClient` agent turn** only —
//! `create_message` / `create_message_stream`. Auxiliary provider calls (chat
//! translation, FIM completion, speech, provider-native search, model
//! listing, and the auto-router classifier) are separate requests with their
//! own shapes and are deliberately not covered. See `docs/PREVIEW_REQUEST.md`.
//!
//! Token figures are *offline estimates* (~4 bytes/token plus a conservative
//! margin). They are never provider-authoritative token counts.
//!
//! The `dryrun` concept this serves — inspect the next request from the real
//! request-building seam instead of a hand-rolled summary — is harvested from
//! PR #1099 by TaoMu (GTC2080).

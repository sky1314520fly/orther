//! WCAG relative-luminance and contrast enforcement.
//!
//! The palette's dark→light adaptation ([`super::adapt`]) is an equality
//! whitelist: a token that isn't literally listed passes through unchanged.
//! That is fine when the surface is the one the tokens were tuned for, and
//! illegible when it isn't — a near-white body token landing on a near-white
//! terminal background (#4833).
//!
//! This module is the enumeration-independent backstop. It works on the pair
//! that actually matters — *resolved foreground* and *effective surface* — and
//! lifts any foreground that falls under the floor, whether or not anyone
//! remembered to add it to a whitelist.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function over colors, so contrast can be asserted
//! in unit tests without a terminal.

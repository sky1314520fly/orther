//! Tool-output spillover writer (#422).
//!
//! When a tool produces output that's too large to land in the model's
//! context budget, we want two things at once:
//!
//! 1. The transcript / tool-cell renders a bounded preview so the UI
//!    stays scannable.
//! 2. The full router input is preserved under its origin session so bounded
//!    retrieval and the raw-detail pager can inspect it without leaking a
//!    process-global filesystem path.
//!
//! The default adaptive path writes immutable artifacts under
//! `~/.codewhale/sessions/<session>/artifacts/`. The historical
//! `~/.codewhale/tool_outputs/<sanitised-id>.txt` directory remains only for
//! classic-routing compatibility, protected by a digest-bound origin sidecar.
//!
//! Boot prune drops files whose mtime is older than [`SPILLOVER_MAX_AGE`]
//! (7 days). Prune failures are logged and never fatal — the user
//! shouldn't see startup wedge because of a stale tool-output file.
//!
//! ## Live callers
//!
//! * [`apply_spillover`] — invoked from the engine's tool-execution
//!   path (`turn_loop.rs`) so any successful tool result over
//!   [`SPILLOVER_THRESHOLD_BYTES`] spills to disk and the model
//!   receives a bounded plain preview: a [`SPILLOVER_HEAD_BYTES`] head,
//!   a short retained tail, and an honest footer naming the on-disk
//!   path of the full output plus a one-line recovery instruction.
//! * Boot prune in `main.rs` deletes files older than
//!   [`SPILLOVER_MAX_AGE`].
//!
//! UI-side rendering is owned by `tui/history.rs::render_spillover_annotation`;
//! it exposes a calm expand affordance and the tool-details shortcut opens the
//! full retained output.

//! Hard per-turn tool-call admission budget (#4415).
//!
//! One counter per turn, built from the task's structured `max_tool_calls`
//! constraint. Every proposed tool call passes the same gate in proposal
//! order, so a batch larger than the remaining budget is truncated to
//! exactly the calls that still fit and the excess are rejected — never
//! executed — with a typed reason carrying the remaining-call count.
//!
//! The cap counts *admitted* calls: a call that debits a slot but is then
//! stopped by a later admission gate (deny-list, allow-list, sandbox,
//! hooks, missing tool) is refunded before it would have executed (#5170),
//! so blocked calls cannot burn the budget.

//! The one place that decides whether a delegated child may make a call that
//! **executes**, **mutates**, or **reaches the network**.
//!
//! Before this module the answer was spread across three hand-maintained name
//! lists ([`crate::fleet::role::RAW_SHELL_DENYLIST`] and its siblings) plus a
//! role posture that keyed on `ShellPolicy::Full`. That shape had a structural
//! hole: a name list can only deny the execution primitives someone remembered
//! to write down, and `shell = "full"` was being read as "may run arbitrary
//! code" by every tool whose approval requirement is `Required`. So a member
//! saved as read-only-with-checks (`write = false`, `shell = "full"` — the
//! `tester`/`verifier` preset, and any `custom` member shaped like it) lost
//! `Bash` and kept:
//!
//! - `tasks{action:"gate_run"}` — runs an operator-supplied command line;
//! - `automation{action:"run"}` / `{action:"create"}` — executes or schedules a
//!   stored automation, with its own cwd and prompt;
//! - `start_mcp_server` — spawns a process and opens a socket;
//! - every repository plugin tool, which is a shell command by definition;
//!
//! each of which mutates the workspace and reaches the network exactly as well
//! as the shell that was just removed, while the receipt said `write=false`.
//!
//! ## What is enforced
//!
//! The classification is derived, never listed: it comes from the tool's own
//! [`ToolCapability`] set and from `is_read_only_for` applied to the **actual
//! input**, after [`canonical_action_alias`] has resolved the family/action
//! pair. That is what makes it cover tools this file has never heard of —
//! plugins, runtime MCP servers, and anything registered later.
//!
//! | call classification | requires |
//! |---|---|
//! | read-only for this input | nothing |
//! | built-in verification (default or test-selection) | shell authority |
//! | `ExecutesCode` | write **and** shell authority |
//! | `WritesFiles` | write authority |
//! | `Network` | network authority |
//!
//! `ExecutesCode` requires *write* authority because an arbitrary program is an
//! arbitrary mutation primitive; requiring shell authority as well keeps the
//! existing posture rule from being weakened. Two carve-outs are deliberate and
//! are the "bounded positives" this module must not break:
//!
//! - **`agent`** declares `ExecutesCode` (it runs a child model loop), but
//!   delegation is governed by the depth budget and by the fact that the child
//!   inherits this same envelope. Denying it here would stop a read-only member
//!   from fanning out read-only work, which is a capability, not an escape.
//! - **Bounded verification** — `run_tests` / `run_verifiers` / `Run` — is the
//!   whole purpose of a read-only verifier, and the shipped `verifier` role is
//!   exactly `write = false, shell = "full"`. Classifying it by tool name would
//!   either take the role's job away or hand it a program launcher, so the
//!   bound is read off the concrete call by [`classify_verification`]:
//!   argument-free and pure test *selection* both cost shell authority (each
//!   forks a process, which `analyst`/`scout` were never granted), and
//!   anything that can name a program is held to the raw-shell bar. Every
//!   consumer of that contract — the catalog filter, the dispatch guard, and
//!   `reject_unbounded_verification` / `is_delegated_builtin_verification` in
//!   [`crate::tools::subagent`] — reads this one classifier rather than
//!   re-deriving it.

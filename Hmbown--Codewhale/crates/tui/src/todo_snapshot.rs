//! Bounded renderings of a To-do snapshot.
//!
//! Codewhale has exactly one To-do list. The model learns what is on it the
//! same way it learns anything else: from the tool result its own `todo_write`
//! / `work_update` call returned, which is ordinary persisted transcript
//! state. **Nothing in this module is appended to a provider request**, and no
//! step of a tool loop re-states the list. If the model wants the current
//! list, it reads its own last tool result or calls the tool again.
//!
//! What this module owns is the small set of places that render a snapshot
//! *once*, at an explicit seam a person asked for:
//!
//! 1. the `<codewhale:fork_state>` block a newly forked sub-agent is handed,
//! 2. `/relay` handoff instructions,
//! 3. the in-transcript agent card (display only).
//!
//! All three share [`todo_snapshot_body`] byte-for-byte, so no two surfaces
//! can disagree about what the list says.
//!
//! Rules the renderer must keep, because this text reaches a model:
//!
//! - An empty To-do renders nothing at all. Silence beats an empty list that
//!   reads as "there is no work".
//! - `update_plan` strategy state is conversational reasoning, not a second
//!   list, and never appears here.
//! - Items and characters are both hard-bounded, so a large list cannot eat the
//!   context window. The in-progress item is preserved preferentially — losing
//!   the active item is the one omission that would actively mislead.
//! - Truncation happens on `char` boundaries and marks the omission, so a
//!   multi-byte item can neither panic nor silently shrink the list.
//! - Item text can never close its wrapper: a closing tag in the `codewhale:`
//!   namespace is escaped before it reaches the model, and control characters
//!   are flattened so content cannot forge a new line.
//!
//! **What this module does not do:** it does not sanitize To-do content against
//! prompt injection, and no caller should claim that it does. The guarantees
//! above are exactly three — wrapper framing cannot be closed early, control
//! characters cannot forge the line format, and the item/character bounds hold.
//! The *meaning* of arbitrary item text is not inspected, filtered, or
//! neutralized; a To-do item containing instructions still reaches the model as
//! item text. Treating that text as untrusted data is the model contract's job
//! (the constitution), not the renderer's.

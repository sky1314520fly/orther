//! Truthful, bounded inspection of a prepared model-client request's tool field.
//!
//! Capture happens at the request-construction seam and retains only a bounded
//! projection. It never claims that the prepared request was delivered.
//!
//! Two kinds of fact live here, and they are kept apart on purpose:
//!
//! * **Wire facts** come from the prepared request itself — names, schemas,
//!   descriptions, per-tool transport flags, byte accounting, and the
//!   active-tool-catalog digest. The digest is not defined here; it is
//!   [`crate::core::engine::preview::active_tool_catalog_sha256`], the same
//!   function the request manifest publishes, so `/tools` and `/request` cannot
//!   report two different hashes of one catalog.
//! * **Surface facts** come from a [`ToolSurfaceContext`] the engine resolves
//!   once per turn: flattened registry facts, the MCP pool's resolved server
//!   attributions, the engine-injected catalog names, and the provider receipt
//!   taken from the *resolved model client*. When that context is present,
//!   provenance, MCP server identity, capabilities, approval requirement, and
//!   model visibility become available and true. When it is absent they stay
//!   explicitly unknown — the context is optional, never faked.
//!
//! What stays unknowable stays unknown regardless: nothing here observes the
//! provider adapter's wire payload, so it is always reported as unavailable.

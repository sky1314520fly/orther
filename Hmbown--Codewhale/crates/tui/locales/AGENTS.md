# Locale agent guidance

`en.json` is the reference pack. The locale registry defines which other packs
are complete; do not treat an old assertion as product authority when the
registry or localization design has intentionally changed.

For every new string:

1. Add the `MessageId` variant, `ALL_MESSAGE_IDS` entry, and English key.
2. Translate every complete pack. Do not satisfy parity by copying English.
3. If an English value changes, update its translations as well.

Keep `{named}` placeholders literal. Commands, key names, URLs, product terms,
and glyphs follow the conventions enforced by localization tests; ordinary
prose should be natural and compact. Preserve intentional edge whitespace.

Localization migrations are one-way: new and touched surfaces use typed
`MessageId` keys and shared packs. Do not add renderer-local language branches
or preserve one because a snapshot expects the old shape. Prefer direct render
inspection for copy and layout; keep narrow parity/script checks only where they
cheaply prevent a real untranslated or malformed pack.

Adding a locale also requires its `Locale` registry/display/parse entries,
onboarding picker entry, `UiLocale` schema value, and setup/config match arms.
The registry is the source of truth. Translated root READMEs are a separate
surface with `scripts/check-readme-translations.py` available as a focused
consistency check.

//! The one requested → effective reasoning resolver, with provider capability
//! normalization, preserved provenance, and durable receipts that carry
//! **disclosure without content**.
//!
//! Models never auto-switch inside the exact Fleet experience. A worker's
//! provider/model is **frozen and preflighted** before this module runs;
//! everything here only decides how hard that already-chosen model thinks.
//!
//! Resolution order for an exact member:
//!
//! 1. A concrete requested tier resolves to itself, normalized against the
//!    route's real capability. **No Router is called** — a manually pinned tier
//!    costs nothing.
//! 2. `reasoning = "auto"` **always** goes to the Fleet's attached Reasoning
//!    Router (see [`crate::reasoning_router`]). There is no
//!    provider-native-adaptive bypass: a route that chooses its own depth is a
//!    fact about how the request is *shaped*, not a reason to skip the service
//!    the operator configured. A missing or unready Router is an error *before
//!    work starts*, and exact Fleets never fall back to the local keyword
//!    heuristic or to legacy model routing.
//!
//! Legacy (non-exact) callers keep the old behavior through
//! [`resolve_legacy_reasoning`], which is allowed to use a local heuristic.
//!
//! ## What a durable receipt may hold
//!
//! A receipt is written to journals and events that travel further than the
//! machine that produced them, so it holds **no task text and no routing
//! summary text** — only bounded counts, a truncation flag, a stable hash of
//! the exact transmitted bytes, what redaction removed, and whether the
//! inference crossed provider boundaries. Everything else on it is an id, a
//! model string, a tier label, or a boolean.

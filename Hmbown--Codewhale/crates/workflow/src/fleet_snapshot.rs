//!
//! A saved Fleet is editable; a *running* Workflow is not. At start we capture
//! a secret-free, durable value containing the qualified Fleet identity, the
//! schema kind/revision/hash, the exact members, the exact routes, the
//! reasoning policies. Authority is absent by design: Runtime derives it from
//! the selected member's Runtime role and the live parent. Editing the saved file
//! afterwards changes only future runs — the snapshot in flight is unaffected,
//! because it owns copies and exposes no mutators.
//!
//! **No-secrets invariant**: every field here is a non-sensitive id, model
//! string, tier label, or boolean. There is deliberately no field that could
//! hold a credential, token, or base URL.

//! Exact named-Fleet schema — fully resolved members, no late model choice.
//!
//! A named Fleet is a saved, reusable team. Two forms of `fleets/<name>.toml`
//! exist and both keep working:
//!
//! - **Legacy** (`[roles]` role → AgentProfile id). See [`crate::NamedFleet`].
//!   Legacy files declare no `schema` key, which is what makes the legacy form
//!   *explicitly detectable* rather than inferred from a missing table.
//! - **Exact** (`schema = "exact"`). Every member owns a stable member id/role,
//!   an exact configured provider id, an exact model id, a requested reasoning
//!   policy. Authority is deliberately absent: Runtime derives the effective
//!   child posture from the selected member's Runtime role and the live parent.
//!
//! The exact form deliberately has **no** late-binding selectors. `inherit`,
//! `faster`/fast siblings, model-strength classes, and `model = "auto"` are
//! rejected at parse time, not silently resolved later — a Fleet the operator
//! saved is the Fleet that runs. Users switch Fleets; models never switch
//! themselves.
//!
//! The **Adaptive Reasoning Router is not a Fleet member.** A Fleet says *who*
//! runs; a Router is a separate, optional, reusable service that decides only
//! *how hard an already frozen route thinks*. An exact Fleet points at one by
//! name — `reasoning_router = "luna-low"` — and the same saved profile may be
//! referenced by any number of Fleets. See [`crate::reasoning_router`].
//!
//! The prototype form (`[[members]]` with `kind = "router"`) still parses, is
//! labelled **legacy inline**, and normalizes into the same captured service.
//! It is retained for compatibility only; it is not a second runtime concept.

//! The wire schema. This module is the whole of what may leave the machine.
//!
//! Every field below is an integer, a boolean, or a **closed enum string**,
//! except exactly three bounded strings: `app_version`, `git_sha`, and
//! `panic_site`. Each of those three has a written rule and a test pinning the
//! rule. There is no free-form string type here and no open-keyed map, which is
//! what makes "aggregates and events, never content" a property the compiler
//! and the test suite can enforce rather than a promise.
//!
//! Bounded is not the same as *built bounded*. These types are also a
//! **deserialization target**: `flush` reads `buffer.jsonl` back off disk and
//! hands the lines to `serde`, which will fill `site`, `previous_version`, and
//! `providers` with any string the file contains. Anything running as the user
//! can append to that file, `$CODEWHALE_HOME` is a predictable path, and this
//! product executes model-authored shell commands. [`Event::is_bounded`] is
//! therefore checked on the drain path, and it is the reason the guarantee
//! above survives contact with the filesystem.
//!
//! Three standing rules for anyone extending this file:
//!
//! 1. **Never `#[derive(Serialize)]` over an existing state type.**
//!    `codewhale_state::Thread` carries `git_sha`, `git_branch`,
//!    `git_origin_url`, `cwd`, and `path`. A payload builder that accepts one
//!    and derives breaches the red lines in a single line. Every struct here is
//!    built from scratch with explicit fields.
//! 2. **Bump [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] on any field add, remove, or retype**, and
//!    never reuse a number. The golden snapshot test fails until you do.
//! 3. **A new string field needs a clause in [`Event::is_bounded`]**, not just
//!    a doc comment naming its rule. A rule only the constructor honours is a
//!    rule the drain path does not have.

//! Transport. One POST, or — with no endpoint — a local file.
//!
//! The shipped default endpoint is `codewhale_config::DEFAULT_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`,
//! the first-party ingest service documented in `docs/TELEMETRY.md`. That
//! default decides only *where* a batch goes, never *whether* one exists: this
//! module is reached only by a session that resolved telemetry on after every
//! persistent and run-scoped opt-out was applied.
//!
//! `None` here is the dry-run sink, reachable by configuring an empty endpoint:
//! batches are serialized with the same serializer a real endpoint would see and
//! appended to `dryrun.jsonl`, and no HTTP client is ever constructed. That is
//! how you read your own payloads — by reading the file.

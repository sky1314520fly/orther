//! Default-on, user-disableable anonymous product usage counting for Codewhale.
//!
//! The whole of what this crate may ever send is [`event`]. The whole of what
//! decides whether it may send anything is [`decision`]. Nothing else in the
//! tree is permitted to construct a payload or to reach the wire, and nothing in
//! here reads a prompt, a completion, a tool argument, a file, a path, a git
//! remote, a branch, a model id, a provider table name, an MCP server name, an
//! approval rule, an error body, a panic message, or a credential.
//!
//! # The shape of the guarantee
//!
//! Permission is a **value**, not a convention. [`decide`] is the only constructor
//! of [`TelemetryConsent`]; [`init`] takes one by value and there is no
//! bool-taking sibling. Six init sites cannot each drift from the predicate,
//! because they never see the predicate.
//!
//! Arming is a **`OnceLock`**, consulted by every write path including
//! [`record_blocking`]. This matters because the process panic hook is installed
//! before the command line is even parsed, long before any config resolution: it
//! cannot consult a resolved value, but it can consult a lock that is by
//! construction empty until resolution completes. A disabled user's panic
//! therefore writes nothing and creates no directory.
//!
//! Arming also **truncates** any stale buffer before a newly permitted process
//! begins recording.
//!
//! # Failure posture
//!
//! Fail-open is absolute. Every fallible step ends in `.ok()?` or `let _ =`.
//! Nothing here returns an error to a caller, blocks a turn, blocks a tool, or
//! blocks process exit. Telemetry that costs a user their session is worse than
//! no telemetry.

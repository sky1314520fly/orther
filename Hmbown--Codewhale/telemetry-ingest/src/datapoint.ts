/**
 * Batch -> Workers Analytics Engine data points.
 *
 * One data point per event. A batch is capped at 200 events
 * (`BATCH_MAX_EVENTS`), and Analytics Engine allows 250 data points per Worker
 * invocation, so a conforming batch never needs a second pass and never has to
 * drop an event to fit.
 *
 * The column layout is fixed and positional because Analytics Engine columns
 * are `blob1..blob20` / `double1..double20` — the names live only in the SQL
 * you write. Renumbering a column silently rewrites every historical query, so
 * the order below is append-only: to add a field, take the next free slot.
 *
 * The layout is chosen so the two questions the owner actually has are one
 * query each. Both queries are written out in `README.md`:
 *
 *   (a) installs and sessions   -> index1 (install_id) + blob1 (event)
 *   (b) error classes and panic sites -> double11..16 + blob16, one GROUP BY
 *
 * Every value below comes out of the validated batch body and nothing else.
 * This module cannot see anything about the connection — that is enforced by
 * `test/no-ip.test.ts`, which fails if the type it takes is ever widened. See
 * the red-line comment at the top of `index.ts`.

/**
 * ACCEPTANCE TAPE — a session created outside the desktop window (an agent's
 * server-side `session.create`, the CLI, another client) reaches the sidebar
 * of a workspace that is not selected.
 *
 * The desktop only receives engine events for the selected workspace and used
 * to fetch every other workspace's session list exactly once per app
 * lifetime, so such a session stayed invisible — even after clicking the
 * workspace — until a full reload. Two paths now surface it:
 *   1. `workspace.reload_sessions`, which the server-side session.create
 *      affordance issues through the UI bridge right after creating sessions;
 *   2. selecting the workspace, which refetches its list every time.

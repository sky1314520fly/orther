# URL / Query-Param State (nuqs)

URL query state is managed with [`nuqs`](https://nuqs.dev). The `NuqsAdapter` is wired once in `apps/sim/app/layout.tsx` — do not add another. This rule is the source of truth for *what* belongs in the URL and *how* to wire it.

## Decision framework — where does this state live?

Pick exactly one home for each piece of state:

- **React Query** → server/remote data. Unchanged; see `.claude/rules/sim-queries.md`.
- **URL params (nuqs)** → client view-state worth putting in a link: active tab/panel, selected entity id, filters, search query, pagination, view mode (list/grid), an open "view" drawer/modal that represents a destination.
- **Zustand** → cross-component client state that must NOT be in the URL: high-frequency, large, ephemeral, or socket-synced (canvas pan/zoom, cursor, drag state, resize widths, unsaved buffers, live collaborative selection).
- **`useState`** → purely local, single-component UI.

Put state in the URL **only** when it is *all* of: shareable, deep-linkable, bookmarkable, survives reload + back/forward — **and** is discrete, low-frequency, and small. If it fails any of those, it does not go in the URL.

### When to use what (decision table)

| Home | Trigger | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **URL (nuqs)** | Client view-state worth a link: tab, filter, search, sort, pagination, selected-entity id, an open "view" modal/drawer that is a destination | `?tab=licenses`, `?category=Communication`, `?page=3`, `?skillId=abc` |
| **React Query** | Server/remote data fetched from an endpoint | `useMcpServers(workspaceId)`, `useSkills(workspaceId)` |
| **Zustand** | Cross-component client state that must NOT be in the URL: high-frequency, large, ephemeral, socket-synced | canvas pan/zoom, live cursor, drag state, resize widths, unsaved buffers |
| **`useState`** | Purely local single-component UI; also the snappy mirror of a debounced URL search | a hover flag, a transient dialog target, the live text of a debounced search box |

## Anti-patterns (forbidden)

- Direct `useSearchParams().get(...)` or `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` to **read** state.
- Hand-built query strings + `router.replace`/`router.push` to **mutate** state. **If the target path equals the current path, it is a query mutation, not a navigation** — even when written as a full path template. Re-serializing the path by hand is lossy by construction: it drops every param the template forgets. Use the nuqs setter (`setParams({ key: null }, { history: 'replace', scroll: false })`) — `null` always removes the key, and only the params you name are touched. Both options are already nuqs defaults (see "Conventions"); write them explicitly because a group whose shared options set `history: 'push'` (e.g. `filesUrlKeys`) would otherwise push a back-stack entry for a strip.
- `window.history.replaceState`/`pushState` to mutate a param.
- Duplicating URL state into a store and syncing it with effects / `popstate` listeners.
- High-frequency or large state in the URL (cursor, pan/zoom, un-debounced keystrokes, big JSON blobs).
- `import { z } from 'zod'` in client code for param validation — use nuqs parsers (`parseAsString`, `parseAsInteger`, `parseAsBoolean`, `parseAsStringLiteral`, `parseAsArrayOf`) or a custom `createParser`.

These reads/mutations are **not** anti-patterns and stay as-is:

- **Outbound URL builders** — `new URLSearchParams({...})` to construct a `href`, a download endpoint, an external WebSocket/API URL, or a `window.open(_, '_blank')` destination.
- **Route navigations** — `router.push('/path/[id]?folderId=x')` that changes the route *path*, not just the current query. A nuqs setter only mutates the query on the current path; cross-path navigation stays on `router`.
- **Read-once auth / redirect signals** — `token`, `callbackUrl`, `redirect`, `error`, `invite_flow`, `new` (invite signup flow), `upgraded`, `redirect_workflow`, etc. These are navigation signals consumed once (often read-then-strip), not synced view-state. Leave them on `useSearchParams`. Key names are per-surface: files' `new` is a genuine nuqs param (`files/search-params.ts`), while invite's `new` is a one-shot signup signal.

### Remembered list-preference exception

Files, Tables, and Knowledge may persist their last-used filter/sort snapshot through
`useResourceListPreferences`. This is a fallback preference, not a second live source of truth:

- nuqs remains authoritative while the module is open.
- Zustand is consulted once on a clean module entry, after persisted state hydrates.
- An explicit URL filter/sort parameter wins even when it resolves to the module default. The
  complete resolved URL snapshot becomes the remembered value; omitted fields use URL defaults
  rather than merging with storage.
- Explicit filter/sort gestures commit the same complete snapshot to nuqs and Zustand together.
- Never mirror subsequent URL changes with a synchronization effect or `popstate` listener.
- Search and folder navigation remain URL-only and are excluded from the persisted snapshot.

## Per-feature `search-params.ts` — single source of truth

Co-locate a `search-params.ts` next to the feature. Export the parser map (and shared options). Both the client (`useQueryStates`/`useQueryState`) and any server component (`createSearchParamsCache` from `nuqs/server`) import from this one file. Import parsers from `nuqs/server` so the module is safe to import in both client and server contexts.

Conventions:

- `.withDefault(...)` on every parser so reads are non-null. A deliberately **nullable** parser (dynamic default, custom-range-only dates, nullable sort) must carry a comment saying why.
- Filter / search / toggle / pagination options: `{ history: 'replace', clearOnDefault: true }` — clean URLs, no back-stack churn. Note all three of `history: 'replace'`, `clearOnDefault: true`, and `shallow: true` are already the nuqs v2 defaults — writing the first two explicitly is documentation (and guards the groups whose options differ, e.g. `history: 'push'`), and `shallow: true` may be omitted entirely.
- Navigations that belong in browser history (changing folder, opening a deep-linked entity): `{ history: 'push' }`.
- `shallow: false` **only** when a Server Component / loader must re-read the param. For loading states during the server re-render, pass React's `startTransition` via `.withOptions({ startTransition, shallow: false })`.
- Short, stable, **kebab-case** URL keys. Renaming a key is a breaking change to shared links — treat it as one. When the parser-map key is camelCase (for clean destructuring), remap the wire key via the `urlKeys` option in the shared options object (see `files/search-params.ts` `uploadedBy: 'uploaded-by'`, `ee/audit-logs/search-params.ts` `timeRange: 'time-range'`); nuqs also exports a `UrlKeys<typeof parsers>` type helper for standalone mappings.
- `throttleMs` is deprecated in nuqs — rate-limit URL writes with `limitUrlUpdates: throttle(ms)` / `debounce(ms)` (the debounced-search hook below already does this).
- A parser **shared across surfaces with different defaults** (e.g. `parseAsTimeRange`) must `parse` unknown tokens to `null` — never to one surface's default — so each consumer's `.withDefault(...)` decides the fallback.
- For an opaque/literal value use `parseAsStringLiteral([...] as const)`; for a custom wire format use [`createParser`](https://nuqs.dev/docs/parsers).
- A `createParser` for a value **not** comparable with `===` (arrays, objects, `Date`) **must** define an `eq` — `clearOnDefault` uses it to detect the default, so without it an empty-array/object default never strips from the URL. Built-in `parseAsArrayOf(...)` already ships its own `eq`; only string/number/boolean custom parsers can omit it. Example (array): `eq: (a, b) => a.length === b.length && a.every((v, i) => v === b[i])`.

### Example — grouped filters (single source of truth)

```typescript
// apps/sim/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/things/search-params.ts
import { parseAsArrayOf, parseAsString, parseAsStringLiteral } from 'nuqs/server'

const VIEW_MODES = ['list', 'grid'] as const

export const thingsParsers = {
  search: parseAsString.withDefault(''),
  tags: parseAsArrayOf(parseAsString).withDefault([]),
  view: parseAsStringLiteral(VIEW_MODES).withDefault('list'),
} as const

/** Clean URLs, no back-stack churn for filter changes. */
export const thingsUrlKeys = {
  history: 'replace',
  clearOnDefault: true,
} as const
```

(The `*UrlKeys` suffix is the repo's naming convention for a feature's shared **options** object — which may itself contain a nuqs `urlKeys` key-remapping entry; the two are different things.)

### Client — `useQueryStates` (grouped) / `useQueryState` (single)

```typescript
'use client'

import { useQueryStates } from 'nuqs'
import { thingsParsers, thingsUrlKeys } from '@/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/things/search-params'

export function useThingFilters() {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useQueryStates(thingsParsers, thingsUrlKeys)
  // filters.search / filters.tags / filters.view are non-null (defaults applied)
  // setFilters({ view: 'grid' }) — pass null to clear a single key back to default
  return { filters, setFilters }
}
```

For a single param, use `useQueryState(key, parser)`:

```typescript
const [serverId, setServerId] = useQueryState(mcpServerIdParam.key, mcpServerIdParam.parser)
```

### Server — `createSearchParamsCache`

When a Server Component or loader must read a param, build a cache from the **same** parser map:

```typescript
// in a server component / page.tsx
import { createSearchParamsCache } from 'nuqs/server'
import { thingsParsers } from '@/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/things/search-params'

const thingsCache = createSearchParamsCache(thingsParsers)

export default async function Page({ searchParams }: { searchParams: Promise<Record<string, string | string[] | undefined>> }) {
  const { search, view } = await thingsCache.parse(await searchParams)
  // ...
}
```

If a client param must be re-read server-side after a change, set `shallow: false` on the write.

## Suspense boundary

`useQueryState`/`useQueryStates` read `useSearchParams` internally, so any client component using them must sit under a `<Suspense>` boundary (Next.js requirement). Wrap the page entry with a real-chrome fallback so a suspend never flashes a blank frame.

**Never `fallback={null}` on a page entry.** The route's co-located `loading.tsx` default export *is* the correct fallback — one skeleton serves both the route-level navigation transition (which Next renders automatically) and the in-page suspend (which this boundary renders). If the segment has no `loading.tsx`, add one; the route transition needs it anyway. Import it absolutely (`sim-imports.md`):

```typescript
import { KnowledgeBase } from '@/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/knowledge/[id]/base'
import KnowledgeBaseLoading from '@/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/knowledge/[id]/loading'

<Suspense fallback={<KnowledgeBaseLoading />}>
  <KnowledgeBase id={id} knowledgeBaseName={kbName || 'Knowledge Base'} />
</Suspense>
```

Reference: `apps/sim/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/knowledge/[id]/page.tsx`.

The narrow exception is a continuity-focused peer switch that deliberately keeps the current
view mounted and follows the full-route plus critical-data intent-prefetch rule in
`sim-react-performance.md`. It still needs a real in-page Suspense fallback; it only omits the
route-level `loading.tsx` that would replace the current peer before the destination is ready.

This applies to **page entries**. An inner `<Suspense>` wrapping a `lazy()` component is the exception: there `fallback={null}` is correct, precisely so the suspend resolves at the nearest boundary instead of flashing the whole route — see `sim-imports.md`, "Code-splitting through barrels".

## Debounced text inputs

Use `useDebouncedSearchSetter` from `@/hooks/use-debounced-search-setter` — never hand-roll a local `useState` mirror + `useDebounce` + a URL write-back effect, and never hand-roll the debounce wiring inline. The nuqs value updates instantly (the input is controlled directly by it and stays snappy); only the *URL write* is debounced via nuqs's built-in [`limitUrlUpdates: debounce(ms)`](https://nuqs.dev/docs/options), which the hook applies for you. Clearing (or a whitespace-only value) writes `null` immediately so the param strips without lingering.

```typescript
import { useDebouncedSearchSetter } from '@/hooks/use-debounced-search-setter'

// Search inside a grouped useQueryStates — the group's discrete filters keep immediate writes:
const setSearch = useDebouncedSearchSetter((value, options) => setFilters({ search: value }, options))

// Standalone single param — pass the useQueryState setter directly:
const setSearch = useDebouncedSearchSetter(setSearchParam)

// Non-default window (e.g. files' 200ms):
const setSearch = useDebouncedSearchSetter(write, { debounceMs: 200 })
```

- **Never write a trimmed value to a param that controls the input** — trimming on write eats the user's trailing space mid-typing and makes multi-word queries untypable. The hook writes the raw value; trim only for the empty-check (the hook does this) and on *read* where the value feeds a query or filter.
- **Keep fetches/filtering debounced.** Where the search value feeds a React Query key or an expensive in-memory filter, derive a debounced value off the instant nuqs value (`const debounced = useDebounce(urlSearch, SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS)` with `SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` from `@/lib/url-state`) and feed *that* to the query — the instant value is only for the input box. Cheap in-memory filtering over a small static list may read the instant value directly.
- Settings list search boxes use `useSettingsSearch()` from `settings/components/use-settings-search` — the shared `?search=` binding for that surface.
- Preserve `clearOnDefault` (empty clears the param), the existing default, and `history: 'replace'`. See logs (`use-log-filters.ts` grouped, query stays debounced), integrations (cheap in-memory filter, instant value), and tables (filter stays debounced).

## Sort convention (`sort` + `dir`)

Sortable lists use **two scalar params**, never a serialized `{column,direction}` object. Build them with `createSortParams` from `@/lib/url-state` (in the feature's `search-params.ts`) and consume them with `useUrlSort` from `@/hooks/use-url-sort` — never re-declare `SORT_DIRECTIONS`/default constants or hand-roll the `activeSort`/`onSort`/`onClear` wiring:

```typescript
// search-params.ts (server-safe)
import { createSortParams } from '@/lib/url-state'

const THING_SORT_COLUMNS = ['name', 'created', 'updated'] as const

export const thingsSortParams = createSortParams(THING_SORT_COLUMNS, {
  column: 'updated',
  direction: 'desc',
})
```

```typescript
// component (client)
import { useUrlSort } from '@/hooks/use-url-sort'

const { sort, dir, activeSort, onSort, onClear } = useUrlSort(thingsSortParams, thingsUrlKeys)
// activeSort/onSort/onClear plug straight into SortConfig; sort/dir feed query keys and comparators.
```

Two modes, chosen by whether you pass a default:

- **Defaulted (the common case)** — pass the list's existing default sort; it must match exactly. A clean URL means the default ordering; explicitly selecting the default collapses back to a clean URL (`clearOnDefault`), and "clear sort" writes the defaults back. `useUrlSort` derives `activeSort: null` for the default state.
- **Nullable** — omit the default when "no active sort" is behaviorally distinct from explicitly sorting by the fallback column (e.g. document chunks: with no sort the query omits `sortBy` entirely and the server's own order applies). The params carry no defaults, explicit selections always persist in the URL, and "clear sort" strips both params (`useUrlSort` writes `null`s).

Sort params live alongside — not inside — the feature's grouped filter parser map (one definition per param; `useUrlSort` owns its own `useQueryStates`, and nuqs keeps hooks on the same keys in sync). Both params carry the shared filter options (`{ history: 'replace', clearOnDefault: true }`). Free-form user-defined columns (e.g. `tables/[tableId]`) can't use `parseAsStringLiteral` and stay hand-rolled with `parseAsString` — reuse the shared `SORT_DIRECTIONS` there.

## Dates in the URL (date-only params)

A date-only param (a calendar anchor, a date filter) is stored as `yyyy-MM-dd` — never serialize a full `Date`/timestamp when only the day matters.

**Local vs UTC — pick the parser that matches your date math.** nuqs's built-in `parseAsIsoDate` is **UTC-based** (`serialize` via `toISOString().slice(0, 10)`, `parse` to UTC midnight). If your `Date` is local-time (e.g. produced by local-time helpers and read by `date-fns` `startOfWeek`/`isSameDay`, which are all local), `parseAsIsoDate` will shift the day by ±1 in any non-UTC timezone on reload/deep-link/back-forward. For local-time date math, use a small local-date `createParser` that serializes/parses on local calendar fields (`getFullYear`/`getMonth`/`getDate` ↔ `new Date(y, m-1, d)`) with an `eq` comparing y/m/d. Only use `parseAsIsoDate` when the value is genuinely UTC/midnight-UTC.

```typescript
const parseAsLocalDate = createParser({
  parse: (v) => {
    const [y, m, d] = v.split('-').map(Number)
    return y && m && d ? new Date(y, m - 1, d) : null
  },
  serialize: (v) =>
    `${v.getFullYear()}-${String(v.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(v.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')}`,
  eq: (a, b) =>
    a.getFullYear() === b.getFullYear() && a.getMonth() === b.getMonth() && a.getDate() === b.getDate(),
})
```

When the default is **dynamic** (e.g. "today"), make the param **nullable** (omit `.withDefault`) and derive the fallback in the hook (`const anchor = param ?? today`), so a clean URL means the dynamic default and navigating back to it writes `null` (clears the param).

## Selected-entity deep-link (store the id, derive the object)

To deep-link a row/modal/drawer to one entity, store **only its id** and look the object up in the already-loaded list — never serialize the object into the URL:

```typescript
const [skillId, setSkillId] = useQueryState(skillIdParam.key, {
  ...skillIdParam.parser,
  history: 'push', // opening an entity is a destination; "back" closes it
  clearOnDefault: true,
})
// Derive — do not duplicate into useState or sync with an effect:
const editingSkill = skillId ? (skills.find((s) => s.id === skillId) ?? null) : null
```

Open the panel/modal only when the id **resolves to a loaded entity** — never gate on the raw param alone, or a dead/stale id (deleted entity, old bookmark) renders a broken detail view and a still-loading list flashes one. A dead id simply falls back to the list; the lingering param is harmless. Because this reads `useSearchParams` it needs a **Suspense** boundary on the page (see "Suspense boundary" above). A separate "create new" flow has no id and stays in local `useState`.

**Close with `replace`, open with `push`.** Opening pushed a history entry; closing must not push another. Close via the setter's per-call options — `setSkillId(null, { history: 'replace' })` — so Back from the list leaves the page instead of reopening the detail (see `mcp.tsx`, `workflow-mcp-servers.tsx`, access-control, custom-blocks, forks). Secondary params scoped to the detail view (e.g. its active tab, `server-tab`) are cleared in the same close handler with their own setter — nuqs batches same-tick writes into one URL update.

**Reusable components** rendered both as a settings/list page and inside a modal (e.g. `BYOKKeyManager`) expose an optional controlled `searchTerm`/`onSearchTermChange` prop pair: the page consumer binds the URL (`useSettingsSearch()`), modal consumers omit the props and keep local state. Never bind URL state from inside a component that can mount in a non-destination context.

## Read-then-strip deep links

For an ephemeral deep-link that pre-opens a modal/drawer and should not linger in the URL (e.g. integrations `?connect=oauth`, knowledge `?addConnector=`), read the param, act on it once behind a `useRef` guard, then clear it: `setParam(null, { history: 'replace', scroll: false })`. See `apps/sim/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/integrations/[block]/integration-block-detail.tsx`.

## Workflow editor carve-out — what must NOT go in the URL

The workflow editor (`apps/sim/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/w/**`) is realtime/socket-synced via `socket-provider.tsx`. Its view-state is intentionally store-backed (Zustand), not URL-backed. Do **not** move the following into the URL:

- **Live cursor** and **broadcast live selection** (presence; emitted over the socket, throttled).
- **Pan / zoom / viewport** (ReactFlow-owned, continuous, not persisted).
- **Drag state** and **resize widths/heights** (panel/terminal/sidebar — high-frequency, persisted as local preferences).
- **Ephemeral diff staging** (`hasActiveDiff`, `baselineWorkflow`, `diffAnalysis`).

Borderline candidates that *look* shareable but currently stay in Zustand because moving them fights existing machinery:

- **Panel `activeTab`** — a persisted local *preference* wired into an SSR flash-prevention path (`data-panel-active-tab` + `_hasHydrated`); moving it would unwind that machinery and risk tab-flash on load. **Canvas mode** (`mode` on `useCanvasModeStore`) is likewise a persisted layout preference, not a destination.
- **The panel editor's `currentBlockId`** (`stores/panel/editor/store.ts` — a would-be "look at this block" deep link) — the only genuinely shareable candidate, but it is persisted and entangled with panel-open orchestration. Adding a URL param for it is a *new feature*, not a migration; ship it deliberately (with runtime verification against a live socket), not as part of a sweep.

Rule of thumb for the editor: if state is socket-coupled, high-frequency, viewport-related, or a persisted resize/preference, it stays in Zustand. When in doubt, leave it and flag it — do not force fragile URL state into the canvas.

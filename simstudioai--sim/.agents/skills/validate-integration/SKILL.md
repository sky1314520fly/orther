# Validate Integration Skill

You are an expert auditor for Sim integrations. Your job is to thoroughly validate that an existing integration is correct, complete, and follows all conventions.

## Your Task

When the user asks you to validate an integration:
1. Read the service's API documentation (via WebFetch or Context7)
2. Read every tool, the block, and registry entries
3. Cross-reference everything against the API docs and Sim conventions
4. Report all issues found, grouped by severity (critical, warning, suggestion)
5. Fix all issues after reporting them

## Step 1: Gather All Files

Read **every** file for the integration — do not skip any:

```
apps/sim/tools/{service}/          # All tool files, types.ts, index.ts
apps/sim/blocks/blocks/{service}.ts # Block definition
apps/sim/tools/registry.ts          # Tool registry entries for this service
apps/sim/blocks/registry-maps.ts    # Block + meta registry entry (BLOCK_REGISTRY / BLOCK_META_REGISTRY)
apps/sim/components/icons.tsx        # Icon definition
apps/sim/lib/auth/auth.ts           # OAuth config — should use getCanonicalScopesForProvider()
apps/sim/lib/oauth/oauth.ts         # OAuth provider config — single source of truth for scopes
apps/sim/lib/oauth/utils.ts         # Scope utilities, SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS for modal UI
packages/deployment-config/src/env-capabilities.ts # OAuth client runtime capability source of truth
apps/sim/lib/core/config/env.ts     # Runtime env schema for capability fields
packages/sim-setup/src/capability-config.ts # Exhaustive CLI input-mode mapping for OAuth fields
packages/deployment-config/src/integrations.json # Generated client-safe integration catalog
packages/deployment-config/src/service-account-providers.generated.ts # Generated provider-ID facts
packages/deployment-config/src/service-account-metadata.ts # Handwritten deployment policy
```

If the block, its triggers, or connector fields use a `selectorKey`, also apply the `validate-selector` skill and read
the key's entry in `apps/sim/lib/selectors/manifest.ts`, its server attachment and provider listing
primitive, and the shared context builder. There is no client provider selector registry.

## Step 2: Pull API Documentation

Fetch the official API docs for the service. This is the **source of truth** for:
- Endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, and auth headers
- Required vs optional parameters
- Parameter types and allowed values
- Response shapes and field names
- Pagination patterns (which param name, which response field)
- Rate limits and error formats

### Hard Rule: No Guessed Response Schemas

If the official docs do not clearly show the response JSON shape for an endpoint, you MUST tell the user instead of guessing.

- Do NOT assume field names from nearby endpoints
- Do NOT infer nested JSON paths without evidence
- Do NOT treat "likely" fields as confirmed outputs
- Do NOT accept implementation guesses as valid just because they are defensive

If a response schema is unknown, the validation must explicitly call that out and require:
1. sample responses from the user,
2. live test credentials for verification, or
3. trimming the tool/block down to only documented fields.

## Step 3: Validate Tools

For **every** tool file, check:

### Tool ID and Naming
- [ ] Tool ID uses `snake_case`: `{service}_{action}` (e.g., `x_create_tweet`, `slack_send_message`)
- [ ] Tool `name` is human-readable (e.g., `'X Create Tweet'`)
- [ ] Tool `description` is a concise one-liner describing what it does
- [ ] Tool `version` is set (`'1.0.0'` or `'2.0.0'` for V2)

### Params
- [ ] All required API params are marked `required: true`
- [ ] All optional API params are marked `required: false`
- [ ] Every param has explicit `required: true` or `required: false` — never omitted
- [ ] Param types match the API (`'string'`, `'number'`, `'boolean'`, `'json'`)
- [ ] Visibility is correct:
  - `'hidden'` — ONLY for OAuth access tokens and system-injected params
  - `'user-only'` — for API keys, credentials, and account-specific IDs the user must provide
  - `'user-or-llm'` — for everything else (search queries, content, filters, IDs that could come from other blocks)
- [ ] Every param has a `description` that explains what it does

### Request
- [ ] URL matches the API endpoint exactly (correct base URL, path segments, path params)
- [ ] HTTP method matches the API spec (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- [ ] Headers include correct auth pattern:
  - OAuth: `Authorization: Bearer ${params.accessToken}`
  - API Key: correct header name and format per the service's docs
- [ ] `Content-Type` header is set for POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- [ ] Body sends all required fields and only includes optional fields when provided
- [ ] For GET requests with query params: URL is constructed correctly with query string
- [ ] ID fields in URL paths are `.trim()`-ed to prevent copy-paste whitespace errors
- [ ] Path params use template literals correctly: `` `https://api.service.com/v1/${params.id.trim()}` ``

### Response / transformResponse
- [ ] Correctly parses the API response (`await response.json()`)
- [ ] Extracts the right fields from the response structure (e.g., `data.data` vs `data` vs `data.results`)
- [ ] All nullable fields use `?? null`
- [ ] All optional arrays use `?? []`
- [ ] Error cases are handled: checks for missing/empty data and returns meaningful error
- [ ] Does NOT do raw JSON dumps — extracts meaningful, individual fields
- [ ] Every extracted field is backed by official docs or live-verified sample payloads

### Outputs
- [ ] All output fields match what the API actually returns
- [ ] No fields are missing that the API provides and users would commonly need
- [ ] No phantom fields defined that the API doesn't return
- [ ] `optional: true` is set on fields that may not exist in all responses
- [ ] When using `type: 'json'` and the shape is known, `properties` defines the inner fields (tool outputs only — block outputs do not support `properties`)
- [ ] When using `type: 'array'`, `items` defines the item structure with `properties` (tool outputs only)
- [ ] Field descriptions are accurate and helpful

### Types (types.ts)
- [ ] Has param interfaces for every tool (e.g., `XCreateTweetParams`)
- [ ] Has response interfaces for every tool (extending `ToolResponse`)
- [ ] Optional params use `?` in the interface (e.g., `replyTo?: string`)
- [ ] Field names in types match actual API field names
- [ ] Shared response types are properly reused (e.g., `XTweetResponse` shared across tweet tools)

### Barrel Export (index.ts)
- [ ] Every tool is exported
- [ ] All types are re-exported (`export * from './types'`)
- [ ] No orphaned exports (tools that don't exist)

### Tool Registry (tools/registry.ts)
- [ ] Every tool is imported and registered
- [ ] Registry keys use snake_case and match tool IDs exactly
- [ ] Entries are in alphabetical order within the file

### Resolved-Secret Provenance and Model Input

For every request field, determine whether it is ordinary API input, model-visible text/structured
content, opaque model input, or a value persisted into Sim-owned durable storage.

Treat model-input provenance as opt-in. Require official documentation or an unambiguous local
execution path proving that the exact field reaches an AI model. If the evidence is ambiguous,
leave the integration unchanged; do not infer a model boundary merely from natural-language,
search, extraction, or "AI-powered" marketing terminology.

- [ ] AI-consumed text/structured fields use `request.modelInput` with `mode: 'project'` and a
      minimal exact selector; nested/JSON-string adapters preserve shape through `applyProjected`
- [ ] Ordinary external URLs, domains, resource IDs, and control fields retain normal request
      semantics unless the exact field is proven model-visible; an AI-backed provider or later model
      processing of the referenced resource is not sufficient evidence
- [ ] Serialized content proven to be sent directly to an external model is selected by
      `request.modelInput`, projected before the existing formatter parses it, and has deterministic
      formatter behavior when a whole-value placeholder is invalid for the serialized grammar
- [ ] Actual inline/raw AI-consumed bytes owned by an authenticated internal route use
      `privateProvenance` (or `mode: 'private-provenance'`), and the route validates
      `validateOpaqueModelInputProvenance` before model egress; storage keys, paths, signed URLs,
      and ordinary remote URLs are not treated as byte provenance, while tracked stored bytes are
      authorized independently at the owning model-egress boundary
- [ ] Persisted workspace-file contents are checked with the shared provenance guard only when
      their bytes or decoded content cross into a model/tool-result boundary; ordinary file APIs
      remain unchanged. Unsupported secret-bearing file paths are rejected at `file_write`
- [ ] Sim-owned durable writes and internal execution handoffs that can enter workflows/models use
      field-scoped `request.secretProvenance`; authenticated receivers validate the exact selection
      and scope, strip private metadata, and persist, import, or propagate it at the owning boundary
- [ ] Private provenance is never attached to external URLs; registered in-process operations
      preserve it through `operation.modelInput` / `operation.secretProvenance`, while proven
      model-visible external fields use request projection and other external inputs remain unchanged
- [ ] No tool performs raw secret plaintext/source substitution or serializes plaintext provenance
- [ ] No `transformResponse` or tool-local helper blanket-sanitizes ordinary third-party results;
      only execution-scoped, activated Sim provenance is projected at shared model/log boundaries
- [ ] Private headers/envelopes are produced and stripped by the shared tool executor, never
      hand-rolled or returned as functional output
- [ ] Every added provenance hook has a concrete Sim `{{...}}` resolution path and a later
      persistence/model/log crossing; there is no generic handling for arbitrary filenames,
      metadata, provider results, or API payloads
- [ ] Diagnostic projection is applied only to values carrying execution-scoped provenance;
      ordinary provider responses, filenames, URLs, and errors are unchanged
- [ ] Tests cover named `{{NAME}}` projection, unproven identical public text, nested and serialized
      shape handling, unchanged ordinary external inputs, malformed/incomplete metadata, headerless
      legacy requests, metadata stripping, and durable legacy/stale/scope cases when applicable

Treat a missing or bypassed model, durable, or internal-execution provenance boundary as
**critical**. Do not fix it with a tool-specific string replacer or by sanitizing every provider
result; repair the shared request, authenticated internal-route, persistence, or re-entry boundary
that owns the data.

## Step 4: Validate Block

### Block ↔ Tool Alignment (CRITICAL)

This is the most important validation — the block must be perfectly aligned with every tool it references.

For **each tool** in `tools.access`:
- [ ] The operation dropdown has an option whose ID matches the tool ID (or the `tools.config.tool` function correctly maps to it)
- [ ] Every **required** tool param (except `accessToken`) has a corresponding subBlock input that is:
  - Shown when that operation is selected (correct `condition`)
  - Marked as `required: true` (or conditionally required)
- [ ] Every **optional** tool param has a corresponding subBlock input (or is intentionally omitted if truly never needed)
- [ ] SubBlock `id` values are unique across the entire block — no duplicates even across different conditions
- [ ] The `tools.config.tool` function returns the correct tool ID for every possible operation value
- [ ] The `tools.config.params` function correctly maps subBlock IDs to tool param names when they differ

### SubBlocks
- [ ] Operation dropdown lists ALL tool operations available in `tools.access`
- [ ] Dropdown option labels are human-readable and descriptive
- [ ] Conditions use correct syntax:
  - Single value: `{ field: 'operation', value: 'x_create_tweet' }`
  - Multiple values (OR): `{ field: 'operation', value: ['x_create_tweet', 'x_delete_tweet'] }`
  - Negation: `{ field: 'operation', value: 'delete', not: true }`
  - Compound: `{ field: 'op', value: 'send', and: { field: 'type', value: 'dm' } }`
- [ ] Condition arrays include ALL operations that use that field — none missing
- [ ] `dependsOn` is set for fields that need other values (selectors depending on credential, cascading dropdowns)
- [ ] SubBlock types match tool param types:
  - Enum/fixed options → `dropdown`
  - Free text → `short-input`
  - Long text/content → `long-input`
  - True/false → `switch` (a Yes/No `dropdown` only when the tool needs a third "unset" state)
  - Credentials → `oauth-input` with correct `serviceId`
- [ ] Dropdown `value: () => 'default'` is set for dropdowns with a sensible default

### Advanced Mode
- [ ] Optional, rarely-used fields are set to `mode: 'advanced'`:
  - Pagination tokens / next tokens
  - Time range filters (start/end time)
  - Sort order / direction options
  - Max results / per page limits
  - Reply settings / threading options
  - Rarely used IDs (reply-to, quote-tweet, etc.)
  - Exclude filters
- [ ] **Required** fields are NEVER set to `mode: 'advanced'`
- [ ] Fields that users fill in most of the time are NOT set to `mode: 'advanced'`

### WandConfig
- [ ] Timestamp fields have `wandConfig` with `generationType: 'timestamp'`
- [ ] Comma-separated list fields have `wandConfig` with a descriptive prompt
- [ ] Complex filter/query fields have `wandConfig` with format examples in the prompt
- [ ] All `wandConfig` prompts end with an explicit `Return ONLY the <format>` instruction so the generated value can be pasted directly into the field
- [ ] `wandConfig.placeholder` describes what to type in natural language

### Tools Config
- [ ] `tools.access` lists **every** tool ID the block can use — none missing
- [ ] `tools.config.tool` returns the correct tool ID for each operation
- [ ] Type coercions are in `tools.config.params` (runs at execution time), NOT in `tools.config.tool` (runs at serialization time before variable resolution — coercing there destroys dynamic references like `<Block.output>`)
- [ ] `tools.config.params` handles:
  - `Number()` conversion for numeric params that come as strings from inputs
  - `Boolean` / string-to-boolean conversion for toggle params
  - Empty string → `undefined` conversion for optional dropdown values
  - Any subBlock ID → tool param name remapping

### Block Outputs
- [ ] Outputs cover the key fields returned by ALL tools (not just one operation)
- [ ] Output types are correct (`'string'`, `'number'`, `'boolean'`, `'json'`)
- [ ] `type: 'json'` outputs describe inner fields in the description string: `'User profile (id, name, username, bio)'` or `'[{address, status, type}]'` for arrays
- [ ] **Do NOT add a `properties: {...}` field on block outputs.** Block-level `OutputFieldDefinition` (from `@sim/workflow-types/blocks`) only accepts `{ type, description?, condition?, hiddenFromDisplay? }`. Nested `properties` is a tool-level construct (`OutputProperty`) — adding it to a block output will fail TypeScript at build time
- [ ] No opaque `type: 'json'` with vague descriptions like `'Response data'`
- [ ] Outputs that only appear for certain operations use `condition` if supported, or document which operations return them

### Block Metadata
- [ ] `type` is snake_case (e.g., `'x'`, `'cloudflare'`)
- [ ] `name` is human-readable (e.g., `'X'`, `'Cloudflare'`)
- [ ] `description` is a concise one-liner
- [ ] `longDescription` provides detail for docs
- [ ] `docsLink` points to `'https://docs.sim.ai/integrations/{service}'`
- [ ] `category` is `'tools'`
- [ ] `bgColor` uses the service's brand color hex
- [ ] `icon` references the correct icon component from `@/components/icons`
- [ ] `authMode` is set correctly (`AuthMode.OAuth` or `AuthMode.ApiKey`)
- [ ] Block + meta are registered in `blocks/registry-maps.ts` (`BLOCK_REGISTRY` / `BLOCK_META_REGISTRY`) alphabetically

### BlockMeta
- [ ] `{Service}BlockMeta` is exported in the same file as the block
- [ ] Has at least 7 templates, each with `icon`, `title`, `prompt`, `modules`, `category`, and `tags`
- [ ] Prompts describe concrete use cases, not generic descriptions of what the service does
- [ ] `alsoIntegrations` is set on any template whose prompt references another service
- [ ] `skills` present (3–5 mainstream, 2–3 niche), each grounded in `tools.access` — flag any skill implying an unsupported action
- [ ] **Each skill is real, not hallucinated** — web-search and confirm it maps to a popular use case attested online (vendor use-case pages, official docs describing the workflow, reputable "top automations" articles); rewrite/remove any you cannot source
- [ ] Each skill has a kebab-case `name` (≤64 chars, unique), a one-line `description`, and markdown `content` with `# Title` + `## Steps` + an output/guidance section

### Block Inputs
- [ ] `inputs` section lists all subBlock params that the block accepts
- [ ] Input types match the subBlock types
- [ ] When using `canonicalParamId`, inputs list the canonical ID (not the raw subBlock IDs)

### Dynamic Selectors

- [ ] Every remote `selectorKey` is classified in the browser-safe manifest and has exactly one
      server attachment
- [ ] The manifest allowlists the minimal active `dependsOn` context and matches list/search/detail,
      pagination, scope, and stale-time behavior
- [ ] Canonical basic/advanced and trigger/action modes project only their active values; exact
      `{{KEY}}` references remain unresolved in the browser
- [ ] Stored credentials are bound to the actor, workspace, and trusted provider/service
- [ ] Each attachment declares and enforces a `fixed`, `credential-bound`, or explicitly reviewed
      `user-controlled` destination policy
- [ ] Provider results are explicitly projected to safe option fields; secrets, tokens, credential
      IDs, context values, and raw upstream errors do not enter responses, logs, or query keys
- [ ] No selector provider module, provider fetch, or OAuth-token request runs in the browser, and no
      selector-only provider route remains

## Step 5: Validate OAuth Scopes (if OAuth service)

Scopes are centralized — the single source of truth is `OAUTH_PROVIDERS` in `lib/oauth/oauth.ts`.

- [ ] Scopes defined in `lib/oauth/oauth.ts` under `OAUTH_PROVIDERS[provider].services[service].scopes`
- [ ] `auth.ts` uses `getCanonicalScopesForProvider(providerId)` — NOT a hardcoded array
- [ ] Block `requiredScopes` uses `getScopesForService(serviceId)` — NOT a hardcoded array
- [ ] No hardcoded scope arrays in `auth.ts` or block files (should all use utility functions)
- [ ] Each scope has a human-readable description in `SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS` within `lib/oauth/utils.ts`
- [ ] No excess scopes that aren't needed by any tool

## Step 6: Validate Deployment Availability (if OAuth service)

The deployment UI and setup CLI do not infer OAuth client fields from scopes. They resolve the
block's generated `oauthServiceId` through the shared deployment capability catalog.

- [ ] The visible integration block has exactly one distinct `oauth-input.serviceId`
- [ ] `resolveOAuthClientCapabilityId(serviceId)` returns the intended provider capability
- [ ] The resolved provider exists in `OAUTH_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`
- [ ] Every field listed by that capability exists in `apps/sim/lib/core/config/env.ts`
- [ ] Every capability field has the correct `text` or `secret` entry in `OAUTH_CLIENT_SETUP_FIELDS`; no CLI naming heuristic is required
- [ ] Shared Google/Microsoft service IDs resolve to their provider capability rather than duplicate entries
- [ ] `npx sim-setup add integration <capabilityId>` is the command emitted by availability; the CLI has only the exhaustive input-mode projection, not a second runtime provider definition
- [ ] If the canonical OAuth service declares `serviceAccountProviderId`,
      the generated `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_OAUTH_SERVICE_ID[serviceId]` has the same provider ID
- [ ] The service-account `deploymentRequirement` matches how that credential actually works:
      omitted for an independent path, `'oauth-client'` when it needs the OAuth client fields, or
      `'preview-gated'` when controlled by a preview block

Treat a missing capability as **critical**: runtime availability intentionally throws instead of
silently exposing an unusable integration.

## Step 7: Validate Pagination Consistency

If any tools support pagination:
- [ ] Pagination param names match the API docs (e.g., `pagination_token` vs `next_token` vs `cursor`)
- [ ] Different API endpoints that use different pagination param names have separate subBlocks in the block
- [ ] Pagination response fields (`nextToken`, `cursor`, etc.) are included in tool outputs
- [ ] Pagination subBlocks are set to `mode: 'advanced'`

## Step 8: Validate Memory Load Safety

If any tool lists, searches, exports, imports, downloads, uploads, paginates, batches, transforms arrays, or reads file/HTTP bodies, read `.agents/skills/memory-load-check/SKILL.md` and apply it to the integration.

- [ ] List/search tools expose API limits and do not auto-fetch every page into memory
- [ ] Transform logic does not build unbounded arrays, maps, sets, or `Promise.all` fan-outs
- [ ] File and HTTP body reads use explicit byte caps or existing stream-limit helpers
- [ ] Large result payloads are summarized, paginated, referenced, or capped rather than raw-dumped
- [ ] Pagination and download tests cover caps, early stop behavior, or partial-result preservation when relevant

## Step 9: Validate Error Handling

- [ ] `transformResponse` checks for error conditions before accessing data
- [ ] Error responses include meaningful messages (not just generic "failed")
- [ ] HTTP error status codes are handled (check `response.ok` or status codes)

## Step 10: Report and Fix

### Report Format

Group findings by severity:

**Critical** (will cause runtime errors or incorrect behavior):
- Wrong endpoint URL or HTTP method
- Missing required params or wrong `required` flag
- Incorrect response field mapping (accessing wrong path in response)
- Missing error handling that would cause crashes
- Tool ID mismatch between tool file, registry, and block `tools.access`
- OAuth scopes missing in `auth.ts` that tools need
- OAuth integration `serviceId` missing from the deployment capability catalog
- Capability references an env field absent from the runtime env schema
- Service-account metadata disagrees with the canonical OAuth service configuration
- `tools.config.tool` returning wrong tool ID for an operation
- Type coercions in `tools.config.tool` instead of `tools.config.params`
- Proven model-visible request fields bypass the shared projection or private-provenance boundary
- Opaque model input is downloaded or sent before provenance and workspace-file checks
- A Sim-owned durable sink or internal execution handoff drops encrypted provenance or breaks
  legacy headerless/`NULL` data
- A tool substitutes secret plaintext into source, leaks private metadata, or generically sanitizes
  unrelated third-party results
- A selector resolves shared secret plaintext in the browser, lacks credential provider binding or
  destination enforcement, or returns provider payloads or protected values across the selector
  boundary

**Warning** (follows conventions incorrectly or has usability issues):
- Optional field not set to `mode: 'advanced'`
- Missing `wandConfig` on timestamp/complex fields
- Wrong `visibility` on params (e.g., `'hidden'` instead of `'user-or-llm'`)
- Missing `optional: true` on nullable outputs
- Opaque `type: 'json'` without property descriptions
- Missing `.trim()` on ID fields in request URLs
- Missing `?? null` on nullable response fields
- Block condition array missing an operation that uses that field
- Hardcoded scope arrays instead of using `getScopesForService()` / `getCanonicalScopesForProvider()`
- Missing scope description in `SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS` within `lib/oauth/utils.ts`

**Suggestion** (minor improvements):
- Better description text
- Inconsistent naming across tools
- Missing `longDescription` or `docsLink`
- Pagination fields that could benefit from `wandConfig`

### Fix All Issues

After reporting, fix every **critical** and **warning** issue. Apply **suggestions** where they don't add unnecessary complexity.

### Regenerate Derived Artifacts

Several files are generated from tool and block definitions. Editing a tool or block WITHOUT regenerating them fails CI, so run these before pushing:

```bash
bun run tool-metadata:generate       # repo root — apps/sim/tools/generated/*
bun run scripts/generate-docs.ts     # docs .mdx + deployment-config/integrations.json + docs icons
bun run deployment-config:generate  # canonical OAuth registry + catalog → provider-ID facts
bun run integration-catalog:check    # registry ↔ committed deployment metadata drift
bun run docs:check                   # committed docs ↔ what the generator renders today
bun run deployment-config:check     # OAuth registry/catalog ↔ provider-ID fact drift
```

- **`tool-metadata:generate`** — required whenever a tool's `outputs`, `params`, or descriptions change. CI enforces this with `bun run tool-metadata:check`, which fails with *"Generated tool metadata is stale"*. This is the easiest gate to miss, because nothing in the tool file hints that a generated artifact mirrors it.
- **`generate-docs`** — required whenever block metadata changes (`bgColor`, `name`, `description`, operations, outputs). Regenerates the integration `.mdx`, `packages/deployment-config/src/integrations.json`, and the docs copy of `components/icons.tsx`.
- **`deployment-config:generate`** — required for OAuth or service-account changes. Regenerates provider-ID facts from the canonical OAuth registry and integration catalog; special deployment requirements remain handwritten policy.
- **`integration-catalog:check`** — loads the executable block registry, derives visible integration
  deployment fields, and compares them with the committed catalog. It catches missing/unexpected
  entries and stale auth/service IDs without loading the executable registry in client code.
- **`docs:check`** — check mode of `generate-docs.ts`: renders every generated docs artifact in
  memory and fails listing any committed file that differs. Runs in CI via `check:audits`.

**Always diff the regen output before committing — but commit all of it.** These generators rewrite
every file they own, so they also true up drift that accumulated on the base branch (pages whose
source changed without a regen). That catch-up is correct output, not a regression: `docs:check`
fails CI on any page left stale, so reverting swept-in hunks with `git checkout --` reintroduces the
failure. Review the diff to confirm each hunk is explained by a real source change (yours or an
upstream PR that skipped regeneration), and investigate anything that looks like content loss — a
page losing a section usually means its source block moved or a generator input broke, not that the
hunk should be reverted.

If an icon changed, `apps/sim/components/icons.tsx` is the source of truth and `apps/docs/components/icons.tsx` is its generated mirror — they must end up byte-identical for that component.

### Validation Output

After fixing, confirm:
1. `bun run lint` passes with no fixes needed
2. TypeScript compiles clean (no type errors) — check the error list is empty for the files you touched; pre-existing unrelated errors in a worktree usually mean workspace packages resolve to the main checkout
3. The integration's tests pass, and any test you added actually fails without its fix (revert it once and watch it go red)
4. Derived artifacts regenerated and their diffs reviewed (see above)
5. `bun run integration-catalog:check` passes
6. `bun run docs:check` passes
7. For OAuth or service-account changes, `bun run deployment-config:check` passes
8. For OAuth or service-account changes, `bun run --cwd apps/sim test lib/integrations/availability.server.test.ts` passes
9. Re-read all modified files to verify fixes are correct
10. Any remaining unknown response schemas were explicitly reported to the user instead of guessed

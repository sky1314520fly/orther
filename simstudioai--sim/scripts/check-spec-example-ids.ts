/**
 * Gates the example UUIDs published in the OpenAPI specs against an explicit approved set.
 *
 * The specs in `apps/docs/` ship in a public repository, so an example id copied from a real run
 * publishes an opaque workspace, workflow, or execution identifier. This check exists because that
 * has already happened: six such ids sat in `openapi-core.json` until they were replaced.
 *
 * The gate is enumeration, not inference. An earlier revision instead scored the *texture* of an
 * id — the repo's hand-authored placeholders are pandigital, using every hex digit no more than
 * three times, which a real v4 UUID was assumed never to be. Measured against 12M generated v4
 * UUIDs, 0.81% of them have exactly that texture: roughly one copied id in 124 would have passed
 * and shipped. Tightening the rule does not rescue it — requiring every digit exactly twice drops
 * the random pass rate to 0 in 20M, but also rejects all fourteen placeholders in use today, so it
 * is the same cost as changing every id. Enumeration reaches zero false negatives for the price of
 * one line per id, and the ids are few: eighteen across eight specs, introduced by six commits in
 * two and a half months, because the specs deliberately share a handful of placeholders.
 *
 * Adding an endpoint whose example uses a new id therefore fails this check until the id is listed
 * below. That failure is the point — it is the moment a human confirms the id was authored rather
 * than pasted, and the diff line records the answer for the next reader.
 *
 * The directory is globbed rather than read from `OPENAPI_SPEC_FILES`, because the gap this closes
 * is precisely that `openapi-core.json` is absent from that manifest and from every other check.

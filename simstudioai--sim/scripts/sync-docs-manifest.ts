/**
 * Generate the static docs manifest the copilot's `docs/` VFS tree is built from.
 *
 * Source of truth: `apps/docs/content/docs/**\/*.mdx` — the docs corpus,
 * whose folder structure mirrors the public docs.sim.ai URL structure.
 * The copilot never reads those files from disk (they are not deployed with
 * `apps/sim`); it globs this manifest for structure and fetches page content
 * from the live site on demand. That makes the manifest the one thing that can
 * drift, hence `--check` in CI.
 *
 * Path derivation (each entry is BOTH the `docs/`-relative VFS path and the
 * docs.sim.ai URL path, so a read is a plain fetch of `https://docs.sim.ai/<entry>`):
 *   - `workflows/blocks/agent.mdx` → `workflows/blocks/agent.mdx`
 *   - `workflows/index.mdx`        → `workflows.mdx`   (fumadocs folds index pages
 *                                     into their parent URL; `/workflows/index.mdx`
 *                                     is a 404 on the site)
 *
 * Excluded, and intentionally absent from the VFS: every section in
 * `UNMOUNTED_DOCS_SECTIONS` (fetch those with the scrape tool if ever needed)
 * and the root `index.mdx` (its URL is `/`, which redirects).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run docs-manifest:generate   # write the manifest
 *   bun run docs-manifest:check      # fail (exit 1) if the manifest is stale

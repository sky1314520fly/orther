/**
 * Fails if a guarded entry can reach the executable tool registry, or if any
 * entry's module graph grows past its recorded baseline.
 *
 * `@/tools/registry` is a barrel over 4,300+ tools whose `ToolConfig`s hold
 * closures (`request.headers`, `transformResponse`). Those
 * closures reach every integration's SDK client and parser, so reaching the
 * barrel costs ~4,700 modules — it was 71-82% of every workspace route's module
 * graph until those edges were cut.
 *
 * Client-reachable code reads `@/tools/metadata`, `@/tools/metadata-outputs` or
 * `@/tools/tool-ids` instead. See
 * `.agents/skills/tool-registry-boundary/SKILL.md`.
 *
 * This regresses silently and cheaply: any file under a route can import one
 * helper from a module that happens to import `getTool`, and the whole registry
 * comes back. That is exactly how it got there — `providers/utils.ts` pulled it
 * in through `mergeToolParameters`, and `mcp-dynamic-args.tsx` through
 * `formatParameterLabel`. Neither import looks remotely suspicious at the call
 * site, which is why this is a lint and not a convention.
 *
 * The registry is only the loudest instance of the problem. The same walk yields
 * each entry's exact module count, so `--check` additionally ratchets those
 * counts against `check-tool-registry-boundary.baseline.json` (mirroring
 * `check-react-query-patterns.ts`): an entry may not exceed its recorded size by
 * more than `max(25 modules, 2%)`. A regression is reported with the dominator
 * chain that grew — the import edge every one of the new modules must pass
 * through — because a bare number is not actionable.
 *
 * An entry with NO baseline row fails `--check` too. It used to be reported as
 * informational, which meant adding an entry source silently opted its graphs
 * out of the ratchet: seven catalog entries were unratcheted while the summary
 * still read "✓ 41 entry graphs within their module-count baseline". Whatever
 * the summary counts is what is actually enforced.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-tool-registry-boundary.ts            # registry gate only
 *   bun run scripts/check-tool-registry-boundary.ts --check    # + graph-weight ratchet
 *   bun run scripts/check-tool-registry-boundary.ts --verbose  # print counts
 *   bun run scripts/check-tool-registry-boundary.ts --update-baseline

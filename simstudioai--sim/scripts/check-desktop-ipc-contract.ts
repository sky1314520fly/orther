/**
 * Audits the desktop IPC channel table against the preload bridge.
 *
 * This is the companion to `check-desktop-bridge-contract.ts` and exists
 * because that one has a structural blind spot: it compares the bridge types
 * against a snapshot the same PR is allowed to regenerate, so a change is only
 * caught if the author forgets to run the updater. Nothing there derives truth
 * from the running wire surface.
 *
 * This script has no snapshot. Every fact it checks is read from the source
 * both sides actually execute:
 *
 * 1. Every channel the preload calls is declared in the main-process table,
 *    and every declared channel is reachable from the preload. A channel on
 *    one side only is either dead code or a call that silently no-ops.
 * 2. Within a channel-name family (`terminal:`, `browser-agent:`, …) the
 *    `gate` and `requires` values agree, unless the outlier carries an
 *    explicit acknowledgment. A surface toggle that a new channel forgets is
 *    invisible in review — the channel simply works when it should not.
 *
 * Deviations are legitimate and common: a channel that READS or RESETS a
 * surface's settings must keep working while the surface is off, or the user
 * could never turn it back on. Each one says so in its own spec:
 *
 *   'browser-import:sites': {
 *     gate: 'app-origin',
 *     deviationReason: 'a read of already-imported data; settings lists these
 *       hosts to show what an import brought over',
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * A typed field rather than a `-- migration-safe:`-style comment because here
 * the thing being annotated IS typed data. A comment is bound by position, so
 * reordering the table would silently transfer an acknowledgment to whichever
 * channel moved underneath it; a field moves with its channel.
 *
 * Run: `bun run check:desktop-ipc`

/**
 * Projects the executable tool registry down to its serializable metadata.
 *
 * `apps/sim/tools/registry.ts` is a ~9,000-line barrel importing all 4,300+
 * tools. Each `ToolConfig` mixes plain data (`params`, `outputs`, `name`) with
 * closures (`request.headers`, `transformResponse`,
 * `postProcess`), and it is those closures — and the SDK clients and API
 * helpers they reach — that make the barrel cost ~4,700 modules to compile.
 *
 * No client-reachable caller needs a closure. They need `outputs` (block output
 * inference), `params` (serialization and the tool-input panel), or merely
 * whether an id exists. So this script emits that data on its own, letting those
 * callers read tool metadata without pulling the registry.
 *
 * Two artifacts rather than one, because `outputs` is ~4 MB of the ~6 MB and has
 * a single consumer — keeping it separate means callers that only need `params`
 * or an id check don't pay for it:
 *
 *   tools/generated/tool-ids.ts        every registered tool id
 *   tools/generated/tool-metadata.ts   id -> { name, description, version, params, oauth }
 *   tools/generated/tool-outputs.ts    id -> outputs
 *
 * Ids are their own artifact because resolving a possibly-unversioned tool name
 * needs only the key set, and an existence check needs nothing more — so those
 * callers load ~100 KB instead of ~4 MB.
 *
 * Each artifact holds its data as one JSON string parsed at runtime — see
 * `serialize()` for why an imported `.json` or an object literal is not viable
 * at this size.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/sync-tool-metadata.ts           # write artifacts
 *   bun run scripts/sync-tool-metadata.ts --check    # fail (exit 1) if stale

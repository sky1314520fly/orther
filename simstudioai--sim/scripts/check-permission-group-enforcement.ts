/**
 * Connects a permission-group config key to the server gate that enforces it.
 *
 * Twelve keys shipped with an admin checkbox, a hint describing what they
 * restrict, and no server check at all — an organization that set
 * `hideCopilot` or `hideDeployChatbot` believed it had withheld a capability
 * while every API route still answered. Nothing connected "this key is offered
 * to admins" to "something refuses when it is set", because the two live in
 * different files and neither knows about the other. This audit connects them.
 *
 * It asserts, in order of what actually goes wrong:
 *
 *   A  every workspace operation declares a capability, or `'none'` with a
 *      reason — an omission cannot be told apart from an unreviewed operation
 *   B  every declared capability exists
 *   C  every capability in the registry is reachable: named by an operation, or
 *      by an annotated call site for the ones the funnel cannot apply
 *   D  every key claiming `enforcement: 'capability'` is read by some rule
 *   E  no key claiming a weaker mechanism is read by one, so a key cannot gain
 *      enforcement while still documented as cosmetic or execution-scoped
 *   F  every member of an exported `*Operations` registry was read by A's
 *      parsers. Everything above can only speak about what they found, and an
 *      operation minted in a form they do not follow yields nothing — which
 *      reads exactly like a clean file
 *
 * A capability the funnel cannot apply — one needing a request value, like an
 * auth mode — is declared at its call site instead:
 *
 *   // permission-group-enforced: deploy.chat.auth_mode — asserted from the use case
 *
 * An operation no group governs says so explicitly:
 *
 *   // permission-group-exempt: <reason>
 *
 * `capability` is a required field on `defineWorkspaceOperation`, so the half of
 * assertion A that asks whether an operation declared one cannot fail through
 * the type system. It survives because this audit reads source text rather than
 * the type: an operation written in a form the parsers cannot follow yields no
 * capability, and without the check it would be skipped in silence — counted as
 * reviewed while nothing had actually read what it declares.
 *
 * ## What "enforced" means here, and where it stops
 *
 * Two different strengths of evidence sit behind assertion C, and the printed
 * total does not distinguish them:
 *
 *  - A capability NAMED BY AN OPERATION is enforced by construction. The funnel
 *    applies it; the declaration and the gate are the same fact.
 *  - A capability reachable only through a `permission-group-enforced:` comment
 *    is enforced by ASSERTION OF THE AUTHOR. This audit matches the comment
 *    text; it does not verify that anything below it gates. Today that is 18 of
 *    35 capabilities — among them `logs.cost`, `inbox.use`, `personal_api_key.use`
 *    and `copilot.tool_auto_approval` — so it is the majority of the registry,
 *    not a rounding error. {@link parseEnforcedAnnotations} records which cheap
 *    lookahead shapes were measured against the tree and why each is wrong more
 *    often than right; closing this properly wants a call graph. What still
 *    holds is narrow but real: deleting a gate AND its comment is reported by C
 *    immediately, and assertion E stops an annotation from inventing enforcement
 *    for a key whose field says `ui-only` or `executor`. The uncovered case is
 *    exactly one — a gate deleted while its comment is left behind.
 *
 * {@link SCAN_ROOTS} is the other boundary. `background/`, `connectors/`,
 * `tools/`, `enrichments/`, `triggers/` and every `.tsx` are unscanned, and as
 * of this writing each contains ZERO operation declarations and ZERO capability
 * gate calls — checked, not assumed. The boundary is documented rather than
 * widened because a scan root that finds nothing costs walk time and teaches a
 * reader that operations might live there. If one ever does, two things change
 * together: `SCAN_ROOTS`, and the `.ts`-only filter in `walk`.

 * set the annotation exists to describe in the first place, so the list would
 * go stale in exactly the direction that makes the audit lie.
 *
 * What does hold the line is assertion E's other half: an annotation cannot
 * invent enforcement for a key whose field says `ui-only` or `executor`, and a

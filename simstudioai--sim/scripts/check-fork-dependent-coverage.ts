/**
 * Fails when a sub-block that a workspace-fork sync can invalidate has no way to be
 * reconfigured at sync time.
 *
 * `clearDependentsOnRemap` wipes every transitive dependent of a remapped parent, and a
 * credential mapped between environments changes value on EVERY sync — so a dependent the
 * sync modal cannot offer is re-emptied on every push, and setting it in the target does not
 * survive. That was the state of 36 fields before this check existed.
 *
 * A dependent is covered when it is one of:
 *   - `selectorKey`      — a registered selector, browsable against the target's parent
 *   - a canonical pair member whose basic side is a selector — verbatim by policy
 *   - a preserved name-based type — the remap deliberately keeps it
 *   - `short-input` / `long-input` — the modal renders a text field
 *
 * There is no baseline: the set is empty today and must stay empty. Adding a `dependsOn`
 * under a credential/KB/table anchor now means choosing one of the four.

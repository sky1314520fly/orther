/**
 * Asserts that no code decides a canonical group's membership without saying which SURFACE it
 * means.
 *
 * A block that is both an action and a trigger holds ONE `subBlocks` array: its own fields plus
 * its trigger's, spread in after them. The two sets routinely share a `canonicalParamId` under
 * DIFFERENT ids — Webflow's `siteSelector`/`manualSiteId` (action) and `triggerSiteId` (trigger)
 * are all `siteId`. Indexed together they collapse into one group whose `basicId` belongs to the
 * other surface, so the trigger member matches neither `basicId` nor `advancedIds` and every
 * group-relative question about it answers for the dormant surface: the canvas card hid it, the
 * `dependsOn` gate resolved it to a stale action value, and the fork remap classified it a
 * dormant member and CLEARED it.
 *
 * That shipped three separate times, in three subsystems, each found by hand.
 * `buildCanonicalIndexForSurface` makes the correct thing one call, but nothing stopped the next
 * caller from reaching for `blockConfig.subBlocks` again — which is what this audit is for. A
 * site that genuinely means the whole array says so in an annotation, so the reasoning lives at
 * the call instead of being re-derived by the next reader.
 *
 * The two guarded functions declare their surface differently, so each gets the rule that fits:
 *
 * - `buildCanonicalIndex` takes the member set directly, so a first argument reading `.subBlocks`
 *   off a config is unscoped by construction. A call taking an already-narrowed local
 *   (`contextConfigs`, `activeSubBlocks`, a `getCanonicalSubBlocksForSurface` result) is
 *   self-evidently fine and is not flagged.
 * - `createCanonicalModeGates` scopes internally from a trailing `triggerSurface` argument, so
 *   what matters is whether the caller passed one at all — omitting it silently means "action".

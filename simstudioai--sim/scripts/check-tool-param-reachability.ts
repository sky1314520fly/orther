/**
 * Fails when a tool declares a required parameter nothing can fill.
 *
 * `visibility: 'hidden'` means "not shown to user or LLM" (`tools/types.ts`), so
 * a hidden parameter has no caller. Something else has to supply it, and only
 * two mechanisms do: OAuth credential resolution, which assigns the fields in
 * {@link RESOLVER_GUARANTEED} once a credential is bound, or the fields a tool declares in `authoritativeParams`, and hosted-key
 * injection, which assigns `hosting.apiKeyParam`. A required hidden parameter
 * outside both is unreachable by every caller except the block that happens to
 * construct it during serialization.
 *
 * The failure this exists to prevent is silent. `createUserToolSchema` omits
 * hidden parameters, so an agent is never told to send one; a tool that also
 * omits its `oauth` declaration is never asked for a credential either; and
 * `validateRequiredParametersAfterMerge` only validates `user-or-llm`, so
 * nothing rejects the call. The request is built with `undefined` in place of
 * the value and the provider answers a 401 that names nothing — which is how
 * 117 parameters across four integrations reached production broken for every
 * direct caller (Copilot's `call_integration_tool` and `POST
 * /api/v2/tools/{toolId}/execute`) while working inside a workflow.
 *
 * The fix is one of three, decided by what actually supplies the value:
 *
 *   - the user types it into a block field  ->  `visibility: 'user-only'`
 *     (`mailchimp.apiKey`, `zendesk.apiToken`). This does not widen what the
 *     model sees: `createLLMToolSchema` skips `user-only` and `hidden` alike.
 *     It only lets a caller send it, and lets `{{VAR}}` references resolve.
 *   - a bound OAuth credential supplies it  ->  declare `oauth` on the tool
 *     (`pipedrive`, `wealthbox`, whose `accessToken: 'hidden'` was already
 *     right; the missing declaration was the bug).
 *   - a block composes it from sibling fields  ->  publish the composed shape as
 *     `visibility: 'user-or-llm'` (`calcom_create_booking.attendee`). The block
 *     keeps composing it — `tools.config.params` runs before execution, so the
 *     merge validation still sees a value — and a direct caller sends the object
 *     itself.
 *
 * Choosing `user-only` carries an obligation: `check-block-registry.ts` requires
 * every required `user-only` parameter to have a subBlock whose `id` or
 * `canonicalParamId` equals the parameter id, because the serializer resolves it
 * by direct lookup. A block whose canonical key differs has to be aligned on the
 * parameter id — safe to do, because canonical ids are config-derived rather
 * than stored, and `backfillCanonicalModes` re-derives a renamed pair's mode
 * from whichever value is populated.
 *
 * There is deliberately no allowlist. All three answers leave the parameter
 * reachable, so a parameter needing an exemption is one no caller can supply —
 * exactly what this audit exists to reject.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-tool-param-reachability.ts

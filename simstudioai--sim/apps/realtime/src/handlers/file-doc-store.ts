/**
 * Shared, multi-replica Yjs backend for the collaborative file-document relay, over Redis Streams.
 *
 * The relay keeps an in-memory {@link Y.Doc} per open file (for the sync handshake, awareness, and
 * copilot merges), but on a horizontally-scaled deployment (multiple ECS tasks, autoscaling) that
 * per-process doc is NOT authoritative on its own: two tasks each seeding the same file from markdown
 * would mint independent Yjs client ids and union into duplicated content (split-brain), and a task
 * only ever sees the edits of ITS OWN clients. This module makes every task converge on ONE CRDT per
 * file by treating a Redis Stream as the shared, ordered, replayable log of Yjs updates — the union of
 * a stream's entries IS the document. It is the "shared Yjs backend (y-redis / Hocuspocus)" the relay's
 * single-replica model always deferred, built natively for our Socket.IO transport on the Redis the
 * Socket.IO adapter already runs.
 *
 * How it fits the relay's message flow (see `file-doc.ts`):
 * - Doc-sync messages no longer ride the Socket.IO Redis ADAPTER cross-pod. Instead each applied
 *   update is {@link publish}ed to the stream; every task's multiplexed reader
 *   applies it to its local doc (origin {@link REDIS_ORIGIN}) and fans it out to ITS OWN clients. So a
 *   client receives each update exactly once, from its own task's local broadcast — no adapter
 *   amplification, and every task's doc stays converged. (Awareness/presence stay on the adapter: they
 *   are ephemeral and need no convergence or replay.)
 * - {@link attachRoom} reads the stream from the head when a task first opens a file, and the relay
 *   AWAITS it before attaching a client, so a late-joining task (the normal case under autoscaling)
 *   holds the current shared state before its first client syncs — a client must never watch the
 *   catch-up land entry by entry, which is the document's edit history replaying on screen. Catch-up +
 *   tail are seamless: the tailer resumes from the exact id catch-up stopped at, and {@link catchUp}
 *   can re-run at any time for a caller that must converge without waiting on the tailer.
 * - The one-time seed is written via the atomic {@link seedIfEmpty} (append-iff-empty in one Redis
 *   step), so exactly one task ever writes the seed cluster-wide (the fix for split-brain) — even if two
 *   tasks race. {@link shouldSeed} is a Redis lock + empty-stream check layered on top ONLY as an
 *   efficiency gate (so tasks don't all run the seed fetch); correctness does not depend on it.
 *
 * When `REDIS_URL` is unset (single-pod dev) the store is DISABLED and every method degrades to the
 * relay's original single-replica behavior: seed locally, no stream, no tailer.

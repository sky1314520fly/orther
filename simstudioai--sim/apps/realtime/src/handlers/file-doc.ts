/**
 * Collaborative document editing (live carets + text selection) for a single
 * file's rich-text editor. This is the standard Yjs "websocket server" relay —
 * an authoritative in-memory {@link Y.Doc} + {@link awarenessProtocol.Awareness}
 * per file — carried over the shared, already-authenticated Socket.IO connection
 * and the room abstraction, rather than a separate ws server. Clients speak the
 * `y-protocols` sync + awareness protocols; the server applies and relays them.
 *
 * Multi-replica safe. The in-memory {@link Y.Doc} is NOT authoritative on its own — every task
 * converges on one CRDT per file through the shared Redis-Streams backend in {@link file-doc-store}:
 * each applied update is published to the file's stream and every task's tailer applies it to its own
 * doc and fans it out to its own clients, so two tasks can never split-brain. Consequently doc-sync
 * messages are broadcast LOCALLY ({@link io.local}) and cross-task delivery rides the stream — NOT the
 * Socket.IO adapter (that would double-deliver). Awareness/presence stay on the adapter: they are
 * ephemeral and need neither convergence nor replay. When `REDIS_URL` is unset the store is disabled
 * and this falls back to the original single-replica behavior (local doc, local seed, local fan-out).
 *
 * Durability: the live doc is projected back to the file's markdown server-side — debounced while it is
 * edited and flushed when the last collaborator leaves — via the app's `/persist` endpoint (the app
 * owns the conversion engine). This replaces the editor's client autosave, closing the copilot
 * clobber-window, and the Redis stream is the crash buffer between flushes. The markdown file remains
 * the long-term source of truth; the Redis stream is ephemeral (TTL'd, heartbeat-refreshed while live).

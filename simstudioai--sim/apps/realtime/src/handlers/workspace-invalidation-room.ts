/**
 * Wires a workspace-scoped, presence-free "invalidation room" onto a socket: the client joins a
 * room named after its workspace, and a `${roomType}-changed` event — fanned out by the server-side
 * mutation path over HTTP — reaches every viewer so they refetch. This is the shared core behind the
 * workspace-files and workspace-tables browsers; they differ only in `roomType` (which also derives
 * the event names, since each room type's wire token IS its event stem: `join-${roomType}`,
 * `leave-${roomType}`, `join-${roomType}-success/-error`, and the `${roomType}-changed` broadcast).
 *
 * These rooms carry NO presence — "who's in a resource" comes from the per-resource room (file-doc /
 * table), and mutations go over HTTP. Membership is tracked natively by Socket.IO (`socket.rooms`),
 * so a workspace switch just leaves the prior room — no room-manager presence bookkeeping to sync.

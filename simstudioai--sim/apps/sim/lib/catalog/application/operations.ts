/**
 * Semantic operations for reading Sim's code-defined catalogs.
 *
 * All six share the policy of `credentials.providers.list`: a workspace-scoped
 * read at the `read` role, reachable by a workspace API key. That is the exact
 * shipped precedent for "a code-defined registry whose availability is evaluated
 * per workspace", and these catalogs are the same thing — filtered by the
 * workspace's integration allowlist, the organization's revealed preview blocks,
 * the deployment's allowlist, and the workspace's own deployed custom blocks.
 *
 * No `delegated` principal kind: Copilot reads these catalogs through its own
 * tools, which share the projection rather than the use case, so adding one
 * would widen authorization for a caller that does not exist.
 *
 * The block and tool catalogs name no capability. They are the set of things
 * the editor can render at all, already filtered per workspace, and the
 * capabilities that matter — MCP tools, custom tools, skills — are enforced on
 * the operations that use those tools rather than on the list that describes
 * them. Withholding the catalog would empty the builder rather than withhold
 * anything a group names.

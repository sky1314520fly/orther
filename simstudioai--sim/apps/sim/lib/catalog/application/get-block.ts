 * An unversioned base type resolves to its newest version, exactly as the tool
 * detail read does — `confluence` answers with `confluence_v2` — and the
 * response echoes the resolved id. Without that, every one of the 34 versioned
 * families 404s on the name the list publishes it under.
 *
 * Every filter the list applies also produces a 404 here — an unknown type, a
 * block hidden from the toolbar, an unrevealed preview block, a kill-switched
 * one, a type this deployment does not ship, and one the workspace's permission
 * groups exclude all answer identically. Anything softer would let a caller
 * enumerate unrevealed blocks one id at a time.

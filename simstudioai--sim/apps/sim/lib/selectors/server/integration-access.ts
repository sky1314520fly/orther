/**
 * Refuses a selector execution whose integration the caller's permission group
 * does not permit.
 *
 * `POST /api/selectors/execute` reaches a provider's API with the caller's
 * credential, so it is a use of the integration and not merely a picker. The
 * authorization funnel cannot apply the rule: `allowedIntegrations` is a
 * parameterized decision about *which* integration, and the funnel knows only
 * the principal, the workspace and the operation. Hence the assertion here,
 * ahead of the provider call, exactly as `knowledge.connectors` is asserted
 * ahead of the connector write.
 *
 * The decision is the one the block-access path makes. `allowedIntegrationTypes`
 * is the shared gate — it intersects the caller's permission group with the
 * deployment's `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS`, contributes no group half for a principal
 * that stands for no person, and canonicalizes each half through
 * `resolveAccessControlBlockType` *before* intersecting, so a group naming
 * `slack_v2` and a deployment naming `slack` still meet. The checked side is
 * successor-resolved the same way, so a group naming `slack` and a selector
 * bound to `slack_v2` match.
 *
 * A `null` allowlist, a caller no group governs, and a selector with no
 * integration identity all pass through; see {@link selectorIntegrationBlockTypes}
 * for why the last of those is reserved for the internal selectors.
 *
 * One service can still map to several block types — the `google-drive` entry
 * authenticates both `google_drive` and `google_slides_v2` — and any of them
 * satisfies the check. That is the catalog's own shared-service convention and
 * not a widening: both block types hold the same Drive scope on the same
 * credential, so permitting either already grants the access.

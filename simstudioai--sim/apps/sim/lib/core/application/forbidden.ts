/**
 * The closed set of machine-readable causes a `403` may carry in
 * `error.details.code`.
 *
 * A 403 tells a caller only that it was refused; the cause decides what it can
 * do about it. Raising a member's role, issuing a personal key instead of a
 * workspace-scoped one, re-pointing a workspace key, and buying an enterprise
 * plan are four different remedies that were previously distinguishable only by
 * matching on prose — which makes every message reword a silent client break.
 *
 * The set is closed and exhaustive over the refusals a caller can act on, for
 * two reasons. A union type makes an unlisted spelling a compile error rather
 * than a new undocumented value on the wire, and the OpenAPI 403 description is
 * generated from these same members, so a code cannot be emitted without being
 * published.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: the cross-tenant refusals (`NoWorkspaceAccessError`,
 * `WorkspaceApiKeyScopeAuthorizationError`,
 * `DelegatedWorkspaceAuthorizationError`). Those are concealed as `404` by
 * `createV2ResourceConcealmentPolicy` precisely so a caller cannot learn that
 * the resource exists, and naming their cause would hand back the signal the
 * concealment withholds.

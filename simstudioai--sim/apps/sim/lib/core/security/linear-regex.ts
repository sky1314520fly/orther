/**
 * Linear-time matching for caller-supplied regex patterns.
 *
 * The built-in engine backtracks, so a pattern chosen by a caller can take
 * exponential time on input the same caller controls — `a*a*b` against a 10k
 * run of `a` measured 213s on JSC and 132s on V8. Anywhere that runs on a
 * shared event loop, that is a denial of service against every other tenant.
 *
 * Screening the pattern instead does not work. `safe-regex2` documents itself
 * as having false negatives and passes `(a|a)*b`; rejecting quantified groups
 * on top of it still passes `a*a*b`. Every syntactic rule only excludes the
 * shapes someone thought to enumerate, so the engine has to change instead.
 *
 * RE2 has no backtracking and matches in time linear in the input. Two costs
 * follow, and this module works to keep both off the caller:
 *
 * - **Syntax.** RE2 implements neither lookaround nor backreferences, and
 *   spells some escapes differently. `translateToRe2` bridges the mechanical
 *   differences and `compileLookaroundSplit` recovers the lookaround *split*
 *   idioms; genuine gaps return `null` so each caller decides how to degrade.
 * - **Throughput.** Measured 0.5–270ms per megabyte depending on the pattern,
 *   against roughly 0.04ms/MB for the built-in engine. Callers matching a
 *   pattern with no metacharacter should take `literalRegex` instead.

/**
 * Compile a lookaround *split* pattern onto RE2, which has no lookaround.
 *
 * Splitting never needs the assertion itself — only the span the delimiter
 * consumes. `(?<=X)Y(?=Z)` becomes `(?:X)(Y)(?:Z)`, and the span of group 1 is
 * exactly what `String.prototype.split` would remove. That covers every
 * combination in one rule: `(?=Z)` alone splits before a delimiter and keeps
 * it, `(?<=X)` alone splits after one, and `(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z])` — the
 * sentence splitter — consumes the whitespace between them.
 *
 * Returns `null` for negative lookaround, backreferences, a middle that
 * alternates at the top level, or any body RE2 cannot represent.
 *
 * Two details make the reconstruction faithful rather than approximate. The
 * middle is captured by *name*, so a capturing group inside `behind` cannot
 * shift the index out from under it. And each iteration resumes the search at
 * the end of the previous delimiter rather than at the end of the whole match,
 * so the assertion text is not consumed — without that, every boundary whose
 * lookahead text doubles as the next boundary's lookbehind would be swallowed
 * (`(?<=\w)\s+(?=[A-Z])` over `A B C D` would split only half the gaps).
 *
 * Known divergence: a delimiter that self-overlaps — `(?<=aa)` over `aaaaa`,
 * or a single-character middle whose matches abut as in `(?<=\w).(?=\w)` —
 * yields fewer boundaries than the built-in engine. Matching every position
 * would mean restarting the scan one character past each match start, which is
 * quadratic on a multi-megabyte document and forfeits the linear guarantee
 * this module exists for. Delimiters that do not self-overlap — punctuation,
 * tags, whitespace between tokens — are exact, and
 * `linear-regex.differential.test.ts` pins that.

/**
 * One reader for the deployment's shape: hosted or self-hosted, whether billing and
 * Chat run, which provider credentials the deployment supplies, and which enterprise
 * features its configuration turns on.
 *
 * Server code reads the `env-flags` constants directly and this module only packages
 * them. Browser code must not. Those constants are computed once from the
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` transport the root layout emits, and a document that never ran the
 * root layout — Next's bare `__next_error__` 404 shell, or `global-error` after the
 * root layout threw — leaves every one of them unset for the life of the tab, even
 * after `retry()` or a client-side navigation recovers the app in place. Sim Cloud then
 * renders as self-hosted: API Key fields on hosted models, no Auto model, no billing.
 *
 * Workspace surfaces therefore read the shape the workspace host context carries,
 * resolved on the server per request and seeded here by the host provider before any
 * workspace child renders. The constants remain the fallback only outside a workspace,
 * where the root layout always runs.
 *
 * Block definitions import this module, which puts it in React Server Component graphs
 * (the block registry is loaded by auth and workflow lifecycle code), so it must not
 * import React hooks itself; the seeding hook lives with the client-side host provider.

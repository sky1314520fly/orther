 *
 * The size is `Buffer.byteLength(..., 'utf8')`, not `String.length`. `length`

 * opening `[` for the first row and the separating `,` for each one after it,

 * `DBCC` slipped past a per-site list.
 *
 * `DISABLE`/`ENABLE` are here because `SELECT 1 DISABLE TRIGGER dbo.audit ON

 * `ADD SIGNATURE`, and `RAISERROR ... WITH LOG` — opens with a word that is also
 * an ordinary identifier, so it is screened as a two-token phrase in
 * {@link MSSQL_STATEMENT_PHRASES} instead.
 *
 * The text statements `UPDATETEXT`, `WRITETEXT`, and `READTEXT` are listed in
 * their own right rather than left to `update`: there is no word boundary after
 * `update` in `UPDATETEXT`, so `\bupdate\b` never matches it and
 * `SELECT 1 UPDATETEXT dbo.t.col @ptr 0 NULL 'x'` would otherwise pass every
 * screen on the advertised read-only path. `READTEXT` reads rather than writes,
 * but it introduces a second statement in exactly the same semicolon-less way,
 * which is what this list exists to reject.
 *
 * `RENAME` is documented T-SQL DDL — it applies to Azure Synapse Analytics
 * dedicated SQL pools and Analytics Platform System, both of which speak TDS on
 * port 1433 and are reachable with exactly the connection fields this block
 * exposes. `SELECT 1 RENAME OBJECT dbo.Customer TO Customer1` is a valid
 * semicolon-less batch that changes schema through an operation advertised as
 * read-only, and `RENAME DATABASE` and `RENAME OBJECT … COLUMN … TO …` reach it
 * the same way.
 *
 * `RECEIVE` is the Service Broker read that *removes* the messages it returns,
 * so it is a write in everything but name. Its siblings — `END`/`MOVE`/`GET`
 * `CONVERSATION` and `SEND ON CONVERSATION` — open with words that are ordinary
 * identifiers (`END` closes every `CASE`), so they are screened as phrases in
 * {@link MSSQL_STATEMENT_PHRASES} instead.
 *
 * `FETCH` is deliberately **absent**: `OFFSET … FETCH NEXT` is the standard
 * T-SQL paging clause, so screening it would reject the ordinary paged SELECT
 * this operation exists to run. Word boundaries keep the additions off ordinary
 * identifiers — `settled`, `offset_value`, and `begin_date` all match nothing.

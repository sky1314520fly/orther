/**
 * Identity failures that every in-process tool handler answers the same way.
 *
 * `unauthenticated` is a caller that never established a runtime identity — a
 * missing or unbindable executor delegation.
 *
 * `subject_user_required` is a caller that IS authenticated but has no human
 * subject to act as, which is the normal shape of an actorless run: a schedule,
 * or a webhook carrying no external subject. It is distinct from
 * `unauthenticated` because retrying, re-authenticating, or fixing credentials
 * cannot resolve it — the operation is simply not available to that trigger, and
 * an operator reading the log needs to be told so rather than shown a generic
 * failure. The Logs detail tools returned an opaque 500 for exactly this for one
 * evening, which is why the classification lives here rather than per handler.

 * unauthenticated failure it is; left untyped it fell past every classifier into a
 * generic 500, which reads as "the tool broke" rather than "this caller never
 * established an identity".
 *
 * It lives here rather than beside its thrower because the classifier must not
 * import the executor-principal module: nearly every handler test mocks that
 * module, and an `instanceof` against a mock that omits the export throws.

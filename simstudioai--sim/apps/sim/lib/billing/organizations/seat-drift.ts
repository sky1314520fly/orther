 * seat-sync.
 *
 * This only catches drift where the DB seat count is wrong. The opposite case —
 * the DB committed but the Stripe sync dead-lettered — is surfaced via the
 * dead-letter report, since the seat counts already match here.
 *
 * Candidates are sampled in random order so that, when more than
 * `MAX_RECONCILES_PER_RUN` orgs drift, a subset that keeps failing can't starve
 * the rest — each run reconciles a different random slice until all converge.
 * Subscriptions without a Stripe id are excluded since their drift is not

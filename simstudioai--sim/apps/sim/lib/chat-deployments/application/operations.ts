/**
 * Semantic operations on a chat deployment as a resource in its own right.
 *
 * A workflow carries at most one live chat, so the public surface addresses it
 * as a singleton under its workflow — `/api/v2/workflows/{workflowId}/deployments/chat`
 * — and every operation there is one of these. `read`, `update`, and `delete`
 * are also what the internal editor calls when it addresses the same deployment
 * by its own id; the resource and its policy are the same either way, so the
 * operation is too.
 *
 * Every one declares `deploy.chat`, the capability behind `hideDeployChatbot`.
 * `list` takes it too: a group with the chat deployment surface withheld should
 * not still be told which workflows are published on it.
 *
 * `workflows.chat.deploy` and `workflows.chat.undeploy` remain the entry points
 * for the surfaces that name a workflow and ask for it to be published — the
 * internal deploy route and the Copilot tool. They converge on the same domain
 * effect as `replace` and `delete` but authorize a workflow the caller is
 * deploying rather than a chat surface the caller is configuring.

/**
 * Reading one deployment, and every write, needs an accountable human at

 *
 * A chat deployment controls who may reach a workflow from the open internet,
 * and `public` removes the gate entirely — so its detail is gate configuration:
 * `authType`, `hasPassword`, the `allowedEmails` allow-list, and the full
 * customization blob. Admin is also the role the internal editor has always
 * required of this read, and `defineWorkspaceOperation` therefore excludes
 * workspace API keys, which cannot exceed the write ceiling.

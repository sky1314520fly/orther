/**
 * The chat singleton of a workflow.
 *
 * A chat deployment is strictly 1:1 with the workflow it publishes — `workflowId`
 * is `NOT NULL` and cascades, and nothing can re-point one — so the workflow
 * already addresses it uniquely and the deployment's own id is a synthetic key
 * for a resource that needs none. The public surface therefore addresses it as a
 * singleton, and a singleton has no separate create verb: `PUT` is
 * create-or-replace, which is the *only* write, so one effect cannot be reached
 * through two authorization paths.
 *
 * These are keyed on the workflow. The deployment-id-keyed use cases beside them
 * stay for the internal editor, which addresses a chat it already holds the id
 * of; both bind the same {@link chatDeploymentOperations}, so the policy for an
 * effect is stated once regardless of how the resource was named.

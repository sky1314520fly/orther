/**
 * Warm MCP connection pool: one reused connection per (server, workspace, user)
 * for the tool-exec and discovery hot paths, replacing connect-per-operation.
 *
 * The key includes the workspace + user because a server's headers/URL resolve
 * from the caller's env (`resolveMcpConfigEnvVars`), so two users must never share
 * a credential-bearing connection. Concurrent borrowers multiplex over one client
 * (the SDK tracks requests by id); creation is single-flight; liveness is
 * ping-cached; reconnect is demand-driven (callers' retries re-acquire).
 *
 * Connections are ref-counted. Eviction *retires* an entry — removes it from the
 * pool so later acquires stop reusing it — but the socket is closed only once the
 * last in-flight borrower releases, so a sibling failure, idle sweep, or config
 * change never tears down a connection mid-request. Retirement is identity-checked,
 * so a stale `onClose` can't disconnect a replacement stored under the same key.
 * Pools are per-process. Callers must release every acquired lease and must not
 * disconnect the client themselves.
 *
 * Config-change invalidation is the caller's job via `evictServer` (wired to the
 * service's `evictServerConnections`), not a per-acquire timestamp check — `updatedAt`
 * is also bumped by status telemetry, so it can't distinguish a config edit.
 * Cross-process, a config edit is bounded by max age (self-heals when a stale
 * connection errors).

/**
 * The user whose MCP server credentials an operation presents.
 *
 * An MCP call connects to a third-party server with one person's stored
 * credentials and is gated by that person's permission group, so unlike an
 * attribution-only read it cannot proceed with nobody named.
 *
 * The principal-bound compatibility actor preserves the behavior that existed
 * before the Logs and MCP tools moved in-process. That path minted an internal
 * token from `ExecutionContext.userId` and the MCP route ran as that user, so an
 * unattended run has always reached MCP as the execution actor. For a schedule,
 * webhook, or anonymous public-API run that actor is the workspace system actor
 * resolved during preprocessing — the billing payer — not the workflow's
 * author. Keeping it is what stops every unattended MCP workflow from breaking;
 * changing it is a product decision, not a refactor, and a workspace-level MCP
 * identity is the real fix.
 *
 * The fallback deliberately covers a webhook carrying an `external_user` subject
 * too. That subject is a real identity but never a Sim user, so it has no Sim
 * credentials of its own, and those runs have always connected as the actor.
 * Refusing them here would break working workflows in the name of a boundary the
 * old path never drew.
 *
 * It is not a separate authorization input: the trusted executor binds it into
 * the principal before the use case runs, workspace reach is decided before it
 * is read, and a principal that names its own subject always wins.

 * Deliberately NOT re-exported from this barrel: `./tools` (per-integration tool
 * contracts), `./selectors`, `./v1` (admin API), and `./demo-requests`. All of their
 * consumers import those files directly, and re-exporting them here shipped their Zod
 * schema construction (~60 KB gzip) to every route that touches any contract — schema
 * objects are built at module scope, so `export *` defeats tree-shaking for them.
 * Import from the specific contract file instead.

/**
 * Shared building blocks for the v2 API contract surface.
 *
 * v2 standardizes on a single response family across every endpoint:
 * - single resource:   `{ data: T }`
 * - list:              `{ data: T[], nextCursor: string | null }`
 * - error:             `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`
 *
 * Every v2 route uses that error family, including the two that are not
 * published: the local-storage upload data plane — `PUT /api/v2/uploads/{uploadId}`
 * and `PUT /api/v2/uploads/{uploadId}/parts/{partNumber}`. Those two are
 * authenticated by a short-lived upload token rather than an API key and are
 * deliberately absent from the public OpenAPI specs (see
 * `UNDOCUMENTED_V2_ROUTES` in `scripts/check-openapi-specs.ts`), because their
 * URL is signed, short-lived, and only ever reached through a documented
 * operation's response. Not being in the document is a reason not to publish a
 * route; it is not a reason to answer in a different shape. What that step
 * promises — method, headers, `204`, and which codes mean what — is published on
 * `transfer.url` in `contracts/v2/uploads.ts`.
 *
 * Every list returns the opaque-cursor envelope (Stripe/Slack-style)
 * `{ data, nextCursor }`, but not every list is *paged*. A paged list also
 * accepts `limit` + `cursor` and can return a non-null `nextCursor`; a list
 * whose result set is small and bounded by construction accepts neither and
 * returns the whole set as one page with `nextCursor` always `null`. Sharing
 * the envelope regardless is what lets a full-set list gain real pages later
 * without a contract change: the cursor is opaque, so the scheme behind it
 * (keyset / offset / full-set) is not part of the interface.
 * Total counts are not returned on lists — they're available on the parent
 * resource where relevant (e.g. `rowCount` on a table, `docCount` on a KB).
 *
 * Rate-limit state is carried in `X-RateLimit-*` response headers (not the
 * body). Usage limits are available from the dedicated usage endpoint rather
 * than being inlined into every response.
 *
 * ## Search, filtering, and sorting
 *
 * One convention, applied by every v2 list that sorts on a selectable column.
 * It is deliberately the narrow
 * scalar-param form the app's own list endpoints already speak — not a third
 * dialect alongside the Logs filter set and the Tables predicate grammar.
 * A list that needs a real expression tree (Tables) keeps its own `POST /query`.
 *
 * Two lists predate the convention and are the documented exceptions:
 * `GET /api/v2/logs` and `GET /api/v2/workflows/{workflowId}/runs` have no `sortBy`
 * (the sort column is fixed to execution start time) and spell the direction
 * `order`, not `sortOrder`. They are not a pattern to copy, and renaming the
 * param would break shipped callers.
 *
 * - **`search`** ({@link v2SearchSchema}) — a case-insensitive substring match
 *   against the resource's *single* natural name field, and nothing else:
 *   `name` for files/folders/workflows/tables/knowledge bases/MCP servers/
 *   skills/credential providers, `title` for custom tools, `filename` for
 *   knowledge documents (`GET /knowledge/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`), and `displayName`
 *   for both credentials and secrets (`GET /secrets`, where the secret's name
 *   *is* the credential `displayName`). It never matches ids, descriptions, or
 *   content. `%` and `_` in the term are matched literally, not as wildcards.
 *   Empty is rejected rather than silently ignored — omit the param instead.
 * - **`sortBy` + `sortOrder`** ({@link v2SortFields}) — `sortBy` is a
 *   per-resource enum, never a free string, because the value selects a column
 *   in the query. `sortOrder` is `asc`/`desc`. Both always have a default, so
 *   an omitted sort is a defined order rather than whatever the planner
 *   returns. `position` names a resource's stored manual arrangement (the
 *   `sortOrder` *column* on workflows and folders) — it is spelled differently
 *   from the `sortOrder` *param* on purpose.
 * - **Filters** — resource-specific and enumerated, reusing the names already
 *   on the surface (`scope`, `folderPath`, `deployedOnly`, `type`, `providerId`,
 *   `resourceType`). No generic filter expression. A filter value that matches
 *   nothing is an empty page, never an error — including a `folderPath` naming
 *   no folder ({@link V2_FOLDER_FILTER_MISS}).
 *
 * ## Blank query values
 *
 * A param sent with no value (`?limit=`, `?search=`, `?limit=%20`) is a 400
 * naming it, enforced for every param at the surface by
 * `V2_PARSE_DEFAULTS.rejectBlankQueryValues` — see
 * `blankQueryValueValidationError` for why a schema cannot see the difference.
 *
 * Every one of these is pushed into SQL, except on `GET /skills` (which narrows the
 * static builtin registry with the same search term, merges it into the DB rows,
 * then re-sorts the merged array), `GET /files/folders` (which applies
 * `parentPath` and `search` in JS; its sort is pushed into SQL like every other
 * folder list), and `GET /credentials/providers` (whose bounded catalog is
 * assembled from code-defined registries before its caller-specific
 * availability is projected). These read a full result set to produce a page;
 * none is a pattern to copy.
 *
 * ## Which lists are paged
 *
 * The authoritative split is pinned in `v2/__tests__/list-pagination.test.ts`,
 * not restated here. A full-set list returns `nextCursor: null` on every
 * response — its OpenAPI description says so explicitly, so a caller never
 * writes a pagination loop that can only ever run once.
 *
 * Every list whose result set grows with workspace content is now paged —
 * including `GET /mcp-servers`, since nothing caps how many servers a workspace
 * registers. What remains full-set is bounded by construction rather than by a
 * caller's `limit`: the four folder lists, whose trees are capped where they
 * load; `GET /knowledge/{knowledgeBaseId}/tags`, capped by the fixed tag-slot table;
 * `GET /mcp-servers/{mcpServerId}/tools`, capped by tool discovery itself; and
 * `GET /tables/{tableId}/views` and `GET /tables/{tableId}/groups`, capped per
 * table; and the credential-provider catalog, bounded by code-defined OAuth
 * and service-account registries.
 *
 * Adding `limit`/`cursor` to a full-set list is additive, but giving it a
 * *default* `limit` truncates callers reading the whole set today, so once v2 is
 * generally available that change needs a version bump.
 *
 * Three cursor schemes are in use. Two are shared codecs in
 * `app/api/v2/lib/response.ts`, and which of them a list uses is decided by what
 * its read can express rather than by preference: a keyset
 * (`encodeSortedCursor`) wherever the page comes from one ordered SQL read, and
 * an offset (`encodeOffsetCursor`) only where it cannot — `GET /skills`, which
 * merges the static builtin registry into the DB rows and re-sorts in JS, and
 * `GET /knowledge/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`, whose underlying query is limit/offset.
 * Prefer the keyset; an offset needs that kind of reason.
 *
 * The third is per-domain: a list whose read predates the shared codecs, or
 * whose page boundary is not expressible as one, mints its own — a bare
 * `encodeCursor({ version })` on `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/versions` and
 * `encodeCursor({ email })` on the workspace member list, the audit-log and run-log
 * codecs in `lib/audit-logs/query.ts` and `lib/logs/list-logs.ts`, the table-row
 * codec in `lib/table/rows/cursor.ts`, and a usage-event id passed straight
 * through by `GET /billing/logs`. Those tokens stay opaque and untouched, but the
 * three whose sequence a caller can re-filter are wrapped in
 * `encodeScopedCursor` at the surface so they carry the same query binding as
 * the shared schemes. A new list should still reach for one of the two shared
 * codecs rather than adding a fourth.
 *
 * ## Query binding and the opaque cursor
 *
 * Every paged list stamps its sort and its filters into the token it returns and
 * re-checks them on the way back in; replaying a cursor under a different
 * `sortBy`/`sortOrder` or a changed filter is a 400 naming which half changed.
 * What belongs in a stamp, and why `limit` and response-shaping params do not,
 * is documented on `cursorScopeKey` in `lib/api/cursor-binding.ts`.
 *
 * The authoritative per-list binding is pinned in
 * `v2/__tests__/list-pagination.test.ts`, which fails when a list gains a param
 * that is neither bound nor explicitly exempted. The two lists whose token is
 * minted by a domain codec (`GET /audit-logs`, `GET /billing/logs`) get the same
 * binding by wrapping that token in a query-stamped envelope.

/**
 * Canonical v2 timestamp: a strict ISO-8601 UTC instant, exactly what
 * `Date.prototype.toISOString()` emits.
 *
 * What this buys over a bare `z.string().meta({ format: 'date-time' })` is
 * *runtime* validation, not documentation. Both render the same OpenAPI schema
 * — `format: date-time` comes from the `meta`, so a generated client parses
 * either one as a date — and roughly two dozen v2 fields use the bare form,
 * including {@link v2FolderSchema} below and most of `contracts/v2/workflows.ts`.
 * The real difference is that `.datetime()` also *asserts* the shape, and a v2
 * response body is `.parse`d on the way out
 * (`lib/api/server/routes/v2-json-route.ts`), so asserting a field a producer
 * does not actually emit as ISO-8601 turns a successful read into a 500.
 *
 * Use this schema wherever every producer of the field provably emits
 * `toISOString()` output — most commonly a `Date` column projected straight
 * through. Keep the bare form for a value that is persisted as text,
 * reconstructed from a third party, or otherwise may have drifted: the document
 * is identical, and a lenient read beats a 500. Tightening an existing field
 * means proving the producer first.

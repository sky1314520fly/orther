/**
 * What a caller needs about the transfer step, stated in the published document
 * rather than only in the source.
 *
 * The URL a transfer hands back can point at object storage or, on a
 * self-hosted deployment, at Sim's own local data plane — so the endpoint is
 * described by this field rather than by an operation of its own, and no
 * OpenAPI document declares it. That is deliberate (the URL is signed,
 * short-lived, and never constructed from docs), but it left the one step that
 * actually moves the bytes with no published status codes at all. This is that
 * contract.

  'Send the bytes with `PUT` to this URL, including exactly the headers in `headers` and nothing that alters the body. The URL is signed and self-describing — construct it from this field only, never by hand.\n\n**Where this URL points depends on the deployment, and so does what answers you.** When Sim stores objects itself the URL is Sim\'s own data plane: success is `204` with an empty body, and a failure is the same `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }` envelope as every other v2 response — `400` when the body does not match the size or content type the session was created for, `403` when the token is invalid, expired, or belongs to another session, and `409` when the session is no longer accepting bytes. When object storage is configured — S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob — the URL is that provider\'s own presigned URL, and the provider answers directly: treat **any `2xx` as success** (S3 and GCS answer `200`, Azure `201`), and on failure expect the provider\'s error document, typically XML, not the v2 envelope. Do not branch on `204` and do not parse a failure as JSON.'

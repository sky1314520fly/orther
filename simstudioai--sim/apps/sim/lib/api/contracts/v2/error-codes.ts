 * The closed set of `error.code` values the public v2 API emits, and the HTTP status each

 * need it and they must not drift: the runtime (`app/api/v2/lib/response.ts`, which renders
 * the envelope) and the published OpenAPI documents (`contracts/v2/openapi/shared.ts`, which
 * document one example per status). Documenting a code the runtime cannot emit — or a status
 * paired with the wrong code — is how the reference stops describing the API.

 * The inverse map.

 * The pairing is one-to-one, which is what lets a documented error response derive its code
 * from the status it is declared under instead of restating it. That property is load-bearing
 * for the API reference, so it is asserted in `error-codes.test.ts` rather than trusted — a
 * second code claiming a status would silently drop an entry here and make one documented
 * example name the wrong code.
 *
 * This describes how a code chooses its status, not every status the surface can send. A
 * route may pass an explicit status alongside a code — `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/execute` answers
 * `408` with `BAD_REQUEST` — so a status absent from this map is one no documented error
 * response may claim, which is what the OpenAPI layer enforces.

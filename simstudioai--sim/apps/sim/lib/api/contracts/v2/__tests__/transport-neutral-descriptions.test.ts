/**
 * Every v2 schema description is user-facing prose on two surfaces at once: the
 * published API reference and `sim <command> --help`, which is generated from
 * these exact strings. A description spelling an HTTP method and path tells a
 * CLI caller to do something the CLI cannot do, so descriptions name the
 * operation and its object rather than the transport.
 *
 * This is a sweep rather than a handful of per-file assertions because the
 * strings that regressed last time sat a few lines from ones already fixed by
 * hand. Anything deliberately left alone goes in ALLOWED below with its reason,
 * and the sweep fails when an allowlisted description no longer appears, so the
 * list cannot rot.
 *
 * Allowlisting is keyed by the description text, not by schema path: these
 * schemas are shared between contracts, so one sentence surfaces under many
 * paths and fixing it must clear every one of them at once.

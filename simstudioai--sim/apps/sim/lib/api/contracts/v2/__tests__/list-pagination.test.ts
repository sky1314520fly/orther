/**
 * Pins which v2 lists are paged.
 *
 * Every v2 list returns the same `{ data, nextCursor }` envelope, but only some
 * accept `limit` + `cursor` and can return a non-null `nextCursor`. That split
 * is a documented part of the public contract (`v2/shared.ts`) and has already
 * drifted once — `GET /api/v2/tables` gained real pagination while its contract
 * docstring still claimed a single full page. Enumerating the two sets here
 * makes the next such change fail a test instead of rotting a comment, and
 * makes flipping a shipped list from full-set to paged a deliberate edit: a
 * `limit` with a default silently truncates callers that read the full set
 * today.
 *
 * The sweep guarantees, for every contract under `contracts/v2` whose response
 * is `mode: 'json'`:
 *
 * - Its response schema is introspectable down to concrete object variants. A
 *   schema the walk cannot resolve is a hard failure, not a silent pass — a
 *   list hidden behind an opaque schema would otherwise never be discovered and
 *   "classifies every v2 list" would succeed vacuously.
 * - A response counts as a list only when *every* variant carries both `data`
 *   and `nextCursor`. A union where only some variants are list-shaped throws:
 *   that is a genuine design decision (is it paged or not?), not something a
 *   pinning test should quietly pick a side on.
 * - Each discovered list's `query` and `body` are introspectable too, and the
 *   pagination params are read per variant. The full-set assertion uses
 *   *any-member* presence, so a defaulted `limit` added to a single union
 *   member still fails; the paged assertion uses *all-member* presence, so a
 *   paged list must offer `limit` + `cursor` on every accepted input shape.
 *
 * `mode !== 'json'` contracts (binary/stream downloads) are skipped — they have
 * no JSON envelope to classify.

 *   connector-meta registry. The block and tool
 *   catalogs are NOT — a workspace adds blocks by deploying workflows as blocks,
 *   and there are ~5,000 tool ids — which is why those two are paged and do not

 * - A knowledge base has a fixed number of tag slots, so neither its tag
 *   vocabulary nor the usage counts derived from it can grow past them.
 * - A table's saved views and its dispatchable groups are capped per table.
 * - A table's ACTIVE run dispatches are capped by the dispatcher itself: it

/**
 * Which of each paged list's params its cursor is bound to.

 * A cursor names a position in ONE sequence, and every param that reorders or
 * re-filters that sequence decides which sequence that is. Replay a cursor
 * across a change to any of them and the reply is wrong in a way the caller
 * cannot see: an offset lands at an unrelated ordinal, and a keyset — which
 * stays internally coherent — silently drops every match that sorts before its
 * position. So all of them are stamped into the token and re-checked on the way
 * back in, and a mismatch is a 400 telling the caller to restart paging.
 *
 * The stamp is applied by the route through `cursorScopeKey` +
 * `cursorSortKey` (`app/api/v2/lib/response.ts`), or, for the three lists whose
 * token is minted by a domain codec, by wrapping it with `encodeScopedCursor`.
 * The table-row lists bind inside their own codec (`lib/table/rows/cursor.ts`)
 * against the same fingerprint.

 * This map is the declaration; the tests below check it against what each
 * contract actually accepts, in both directions. A list that gains a filter

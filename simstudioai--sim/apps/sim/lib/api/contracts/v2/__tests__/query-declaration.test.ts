/**
 * Every v2 contract must declare a `query` schema, and it must be `.strict()`.
 *
 * `parseRequest` validates the query slice only when the contract declares one
 * (`contract.query ? validate : skip`). A contract with no `query` therefore
 * never validates the query string at all: `GET /api/v2/workflows/{workflowId}?bogus=1`
 * answered 200 while every v2 list answered 400 for the same shape. The caller
 * learns nothing about the param the server ignored, which is the failure the
 * lists' `.strict()` rule already exists to prevent — a request the server did
 * not honour must not come back 200.
 *
 * The endpoints that take no query say so with `noInputSchema`
 * (`z.object({}).strict()`) rather than by omission, because omission and "takes
 * nothing" were indistinguishable — which is exactly how 69 of them ended up
 * unvalidated without anyone deciding they should be.
 *
 * This sweep is the enforcement, not the 69-contract edit that accompanied it. A
 * one-time edit leaves number 70 free to regress; walking the tree means a new
 * contract fails here the moment it is written, and names itself in the failure.
 *
 * A compile-time gate on `defineRouteContract` was tried first and rejected:
 * making `query` conditionally required on a `/api/v2/` path turns the parameter
 * into an intersection, and the intersection collapses inference of `TParams`,
 * `TBody`, and `THeaders` to `undefined`, breaking every OpenAPI document that
 * reads them back off the contract. The sweep is also the wider net — it sees
 * every contract in the tree, including any a type on that one function would
 * never be asked about.

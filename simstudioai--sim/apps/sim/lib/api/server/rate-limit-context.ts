 * Request-scoped carrier for the rate-limit snapshot, so response headers can be

 *
 * A route computes its rate limit at the top of the handler but returns from
 * many places — success, validation failure, not-found, access denied, and the
 * unhandled-error path inside `withRouteHandler`. Decorating each return means
 * the headers are only as complete as the least-careful branch, and a new branch
 * silently ships without them. Recording the snapshot once lets
 * `withRouteHandler` publish it on whatever response comes back.
 *
 * A `WeakMap` keyed by the request avoids `AsyncLocalStorage` plumbing and needs
 * no cleanup: the entry becomes collectable as soon as the request object does.
 * Routes that never record a snapshot (everything outside the v1 API) read
 * `undefined` and are left untouched.

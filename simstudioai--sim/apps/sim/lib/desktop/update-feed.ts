/**
 * Per-environment desktop update feed resolution.
 *
 * Installed desktop shells ask the Sim deployment they are pointed at —
 * `GET <origin>/api/desktop/update/latest-mac.yml` — instead of a global
 * GitHub feed, so each environment independently controls which shell build
 * its clients are offered. The environment IS the channel:
 *
 * - hosted `dev` deployment     → `dev`     (per-push prerelease builds from `dev`)
 * - hosted `staging` deployment → `staging` (per-push prerelease builds from `staging`)
 * - production + self-hosted    → `latest`  (stable vX.Y.Z releases only)
 *
 * Artifacts stay on GitHub Releases (dumb storage). Stable releases live in
 * the source repository; dev and staging releases live in a release-only
 * repository so source-repository followers are not notified for every shell
 * build. The feed route picks both the repository and release for its channel,
 * then serves that release's electron-updater manifest with download URLs
 * rewritten to absolute GitHub asset URLs.
 *
 * Streams are strictly isolated: dev serves `-dev.` prereleases, staging
 * `-staging.`, and `latest` only stable releases. The legacy `-alpha.` and
 * `-beta.` tags remain readable so already-published builds keep updating. Builds
 * carry per-channel app identity (Sim Dev / Sim Staging / Sim), so serving a
 * stable prod-identity artifact to a dev shell would offer an update
 * Squirrel.Mac cannot apply (bundle-id mismatch) — each channel only ever
 * moves forward on its own artifacts.

'use client'

/**
 * Reports which renderer-owned panel currently owns the user's interaction
 * context, so the desktop shell can route global menu accelerators — a Cmd-W
 * typed into a shell should close that shell, not the window.
 *
 * Tracking belongs to the PANEL, not to the widgets inside it. A panel that
 * renders N children (terminal tabs) must not let each child report on its own
 * unmount: the shell holds a single flag per panel, so one child tearing down
 * would erase a sibling's live claim, and the accelerator would fall through to
 * closing the window.
 *
 * The claim follows real interaction, and only that: a document-level
 * `pointerdown` or `focusin` landing inside the panel. Appearing on screen is
 * NOT a claim — the agent opens these panels on the user's behalf, and a panel
 * that claimed on appearance would answer a Cmd-W aimed at the chat by closing
 * something the user never touched.
 *
 * This covers only what the shell cannot see for itself — renderer-owned
 * chrome. Content rendered in a native view above the renderer (the browser's
 * page) emits no DOM events here, and needs none: the shell reads that focus
 * directly from the view's own `webContents`.

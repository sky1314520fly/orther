 * deliberately. That module reads `x-ratelimit-reset` as UTC epoch seconds,
 * which is what GitHub and X document; the OpenAI family spells the same idea as
 * `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens` carrying a Go duration. Teaching the shared reader
 * both spellings would change the retry behaviour of every connector that goes

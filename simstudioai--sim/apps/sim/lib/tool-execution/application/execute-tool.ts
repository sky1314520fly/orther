 * argument (`llm-only`), either (`user-or-llm`), or neither (`hidden`). A direct
 * call has no editor and no agent block, so those roles collapse — the caller is
 * the only source there is. `createUserToolSchema`, which is what both this
 * endpoint and Copilot's `call_integration_tool` publish, already says as much
 * by omitting `hidden` and nothing else.
 *
 * So the rule here is not about roles: **Sim supplies it, or the caller must.**
 * `hidden` is skipped because Sim fills it from a resolved credential or a
 * hosted key — and `check-tool-param-reachability` is what makes that safe to
 * assume, since it fails any required `hidden` parameter without a declared
 * filler.
 *
 * Nothing else had checked these. `validateRequiredParametersAfterMerge` covers
 * `user-or-llm` alone, because on the workflow path the rest were validated
 * during serialization against the block fields holding them, and this path has
 * no serialization step. Omitting `zendesk_get_ticket`'s `subdomain` reached
 * Zendesk as `undefined` and came back a provider authentication failure — the
 * same undiagnosable shape this branch set out to remove.

 *    leaks nothing, and it is a decision an organization admin made and can
 *    reverse — which a `404` would hide.

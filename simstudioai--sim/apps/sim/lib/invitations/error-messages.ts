/**
 * Human-readable copy for invitation accept/decline failures. The accept and
 * reject routes return `{ error: <kind> }` where `<kind>` is a machine code

 * thrown error's `message`. In-app surfaces (the workspace-switcher
 * invitations modal) map the code through here so users see a sentence, not a
 * kebab-case token. The full-page `/invite` flow has its own richer map (with
 * retry/auth affordances); this is the message-only slice for the in-app path.

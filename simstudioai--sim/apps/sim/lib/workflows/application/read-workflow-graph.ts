/**
 * Reads a workflow's editable draft graph, unsanitized.
 *
 * The same semantic operation as `readWorkflow` — "read this workflow" — and the
 * same loader, so the two reads cannot disagree about migrate-on-read.
 *
 * Records **no** semantic audit, deliberately. This is the pollable read; the
 * audited, portable, sanitized one is `workflows.export`, and auditing here
 * would force `headSafe: false` and make the endpoint unusable for polling.
 *
 * Existence is decided by the workflow row alone, never by the block rows.
 * `loadWorkflowFromNormalizedTables` answers `null` for a workflow with zero
 * blocks, and a blockless draft is a legitimate state a client can reach — a
 * `PUT /state` of `{ blocks: {}, edges: [] }` writes exactly that. Reading it
 * back as `not_found` would break the read-modify-write round trip the graph
 * schema promises, so the null is projected as an empty graph instead.

 * Normalizes a workflow graph into the exact shape the normalized tables expect,

 *
 * Callers today: `PUT /api/workflows/[id]/state` (the editor and the in-app zip
 * importer, which reaches it over HTTP) and `POST /api/v1/workflows/import`.
 *
 * The steps are order-dependent:
 * 1. Strip secrets from inline agent-tool definitions.
 * 2. Drop blocks missing `type`/`name` — reporting each one — and backfill the
 *    columns the tables require, so a partial block cannot violate a NOT NULL
 *    constraint.
 * 3. Drop edges whose endpoints no longer resolve — `workflow_edges` has
 *    foreign keys onto `workflow_blocks`, so a dangling edge would otherwise
 *    abort the whole transaction with an opaque database error.
 * 4. Recompute loop and parallel containers from the surviving blocks, which
 *    are the canonical source for both.

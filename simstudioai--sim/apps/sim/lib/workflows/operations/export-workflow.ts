/**
 * Loads the workflow's normalized state, sanitizes it, and assembles the

 * normalized state (the caller renders its own 404).
 *
 * Server-only assembly of the public workflow-export payload, shared by the v1
 * and v2 export routes so both surfaces emit byte-identical envelopes.
 *
 * Unlike the admin export (`/api/v1/admin/workflows/[id]/export`), which emits
 * the raw state for backup/restore, this runs the payload through
 * `sanitizeForExport`, which nulls five classes of sub-block value:
 * - `password: true` fields, unless the value is a whole `{{ENV_VAR}}`
 *   reference, which is preserved so the import resolves it in the target
 *   workspace;
 * - `oauth-input` credentials;
 * - sensitive nested `tool-input` params and params without authoritative metadata;
 * - opaque credential-bearing values such as arbitrary table cells;
 * - **workspace-scoped bindings** — selector fields and id-keyed fields that
 *   point at rows that do not exist in another workspace, cleared rather than
 *   carried across as dangling ids.
 *
 * The last two classes mean an export is **not** a byte-for-byte clone even when
 * re-imported into the same workspace: those bindings and every table come back
 * empty and must be re-entered. This matches the in-app export.
 *
 * Workflow **variables** are emitted as stored: they are plaintext workflow
 * configuration readable by anyone with workspace read (the same permission the
 * export routes require); secrets belong in environment variables, which travel
 * as unresolved `{{ENV_VAR}}` references.

 * value served both spaces. A block configured for Create Record and later
 * switched to Read Records without clearing the field carries the JSON body
 * under `fields` while `operation` already reads `servicenow_read_record`, so
 * the operation scope alone cannot tell a projection from a body. Promoting a
 * body onto `readFields` would send it as `sysparm_fields`, which is exactly
 * the cross-space leak the rename closed.
 *
 * The test is a positive allowlist, not a check for body-shaped input, because
 * a body is only reliably recognisable when it is well formed. A saved body can
 * be a half-typed draft (`{"short_description": `) or carry an unquoted
 * `<block.output>` reference, so neither "opens with a brace" nor "fails to
 * parse as JSON" identifies one: the first misses a bare scalar body like
 * `true`, the second misses both of those. Migrating one would move it to
 * `readFields` AND drop the original key, losing the draft.
 *
 * A projection is a comma-separated list of ServiceNow field names, which are
 * word characters plus the dot of a dotted walk. Anything carrying a brace,
 * quote, colon, angle bracket or interior space fails that shape. `JSON.parse`
 * then removes the bare scalars (`true`, `42`, `null`) that satisfy it by
 * accident. Ambiguity resolves to "not a projection", leaving the value on
 * `fields` where the Create/Update control still owns it.

/**
 * Renders the readings a canvas sentence actually has on a card.
 *
 * The single definition of what a sentence "says". Validation compares
 * operations through it, the CI check prints it, and the audit corpus builder
 * hands it to reviewers.
 *
 * It delegates to `resolveCanvasSentence` rather than walking the clauses
 * itself, because every previous version was a second implementation that
 * drifted: one modelled the superseded `required`/`fallback` DSL and reported
 * zero empty sentences while 3,146 cards painted nothing; its replacement
 * ignored field visibility and printed healthy prose for 35 cards that render
 * nothing at all. A reviewer reading output from a different renderer than the
 * card uses is reviewing fiction, so there is now only one renderer.

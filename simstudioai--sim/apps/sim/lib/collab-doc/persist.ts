 * - `missing` — the file is gone (deleted); nothing to write.
 * - `conflict` — the file changed out-of-band since the relay's live doc last synced, so writing the
 *   projection would clobber that change (RFC 7232 `If-Match` failure). NOT written; the relay leaves the
 *   durable content authoritative and does not advance its synced version (a later flush reconciles once

/**
 * Project a live collaborative document back to durable markdown and write it to the file. The realtime
 * relay owns the live Yjs doc but not the conversion engine or blob/DB access, so it ships the doc state
 * here and the app persists it — the server-authoritative durable path that replaces the editor's
 * client-side autosave.
 *
 * `expectedVersion` (the durable CONTENT version, `content_updated_at` epoch ms, the relay's live doc last
 * synced from) is the optimistic-concurrency guard: the write commits only if the file is still at that
 * content version — a rename/move that only bumps `updatedAt` won't trip it, so a
 * projection built from a stale live doc can never silently overwrite an out-of-band edit. On a version
 * mismatch this returns `conflict` (the current durable version) instead of writing — the relay adopts
 * it as its new If-Match and retries against the current live stream. Omit `expectedVersion` to write
 * unconditionally (e.g. the first persist, before any synced version exists).
 *
 * `userId` is attribution only (blob metadata); the caller is already trusted via the `x-api-key` gate.

 * A stale If-Match does not prove someone else wrote the file — so ask the CONTENT, not the clock.

 * The relay's token is a remembered timestamp: it lives in the room (lost when the room is dropped) and
 * in a cluster key written best-effort, so a process that dies in the moments after a successful write
 * comes back holding a version older than the file's. Every later persist then fails the CAS, and
 * because a conflict deliberately neither writes nor advances the token, the room can never persist
 * again: the session's edits stay in the stream, the durable markdown freezes at the last write, and
 * every reload renders that stale markdown before the live document corrects it on screen.
 *
 * The guard exists to protect content the live document has never seen. The file's own bytes settle
 * that directly: if they hash to what this document last projected ({@link collabDocStateSourceHash},
 * written with every successful persist), then nothing out-of-band exists and the write is safe — retry
 * it once against the file's current version. If they hash to anything else, the change is real, the
 * conflict stands, and the durable content stays authoritative exactly as before.

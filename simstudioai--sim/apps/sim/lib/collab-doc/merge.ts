/**
 * Compute the minimal Yjs diff that turns `docState` — the live collaborative document as the realtime
 * relay currently holds it — into `markdown`. This is the Stage C "copilot writes into the open doc"
 * primitive: the relay owns the doc but not the conversion engine, so it ships the current state here
 * and applies the returned diff, which Yjs merges with any concurrent user edits before relaying it to
 * every connected editor.
 *
 * `applyMarkdownToYDoc` performs a real `updateYFragment` diff (not a replace), so paragraphs the diff
 * does not touch are preserved even while the user edits them. A region the incoming `markdown` DOES
 * change is reconciled toward that markdown — a concurrent user edit inside such a region is diffed
 * away, since `markdown` is built from a base snapshot, not the user's in-flight text. The returned
 * update is relative to the document's state at call time (`Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(doc, before)`), so it
 * is exactly the change to apply — and is empty (a no-op update) when `markdown` already matches.

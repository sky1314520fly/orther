/**
 * Joins a custom block's child run into its parent's trace, so an orchestrator
 * workflow's log shows the whole cross-workspace execution in one waterfall.
 *
 * There is deliberately no check on the READER: whether a block's runs may be shown
 * to consumers is the publisher's org-wide decision and is the same answer for
 * everyone. That decision is read here, live, per boundary — not inferred from the
 * handle's presence.
 *
 * Reading it live rather than trusting the handle is what makes the policy safe to
 * apply to logs that already exist. A handle persisted before the policy existed
 * meant something else entirely ("a child ran; authorize the reader"), and treating
 * it as consent would hand out the internals of every block whose publisher never
 * opted in. It also means turning the policy OFF closes the runs already recorded,
 * which is what a governance switch has to do to be worth anything.
 *
 * The two halves are not redundant. The handler withholds the handle at write time,
 * so a run executed while the block was closed stays closed forever, even if the
 * publisher opens the block later; this check then decides whether the runs that DO
 * carry a handle may still be shown.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and worth stating: for an opted-in block, anyone who
 * can read the consuming workflow's log sees the source workflow's block names,
 * inputs, outputs, and prompts — including consumers with no access to the source
 * workspace. That is what the publisher turned on.
 *
 * Mutates `spans` in place — callers pass a freshly materialized, request-local
 * tree, and copying it would double the peak memory of a large trace.
 *
 * Never throws: a failure to join degrades to an unexpanded boundary span rather
 * than failing the parent's log detail.

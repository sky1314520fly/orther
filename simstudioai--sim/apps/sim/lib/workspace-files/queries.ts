/**
 * Lists a workspace's files with each file's public share joined on, parsed through the
 * `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/files` response contract so the workspace layout's server seed
 * caches exactly the shape that route returns.
 *
 * Parsing through the route contract's response schema strips the server-only fields
 * `requestJson` strips on the client (`contentUpdatedAt`), so a prefetched entry is identical
 * to a client fetch rather than carrying a field that vanishes on the next refetch.
 *
 * Callers authorize the viewer against `workspaceId` first.
 *
 * `maxRows` bounds the result for a caller that only uses the list if the whole workspace
 * fits a payload budget: on overflow it returns `null` rather than the prefix, so a
 * truncated read is never presented as the workspace's files. The two reads still run
 * concurrently, since under-budget workspaces are the common case.
 *
 * `throwOnError` propagates a failed file read instead of degrading to an empty list,
 * which a cache seed would store as authoritative.

 * serializes concurrent edits to one file so two agents do not both read the
 * same text and each write a version missing the other's change; it is
 * best-effort and no-ops without Redis. `expectedUpdatedAt` is the guard that
 * actually holds: the manager compares it under `select ... for update` and
 * refuses a stale write outright. It is deliberately `contentUpdatedAt` and not
 * `updatedAt`, because a rename or a move bumps the latter and would fail an

 * dispatches a replacement, the replacement sets `syncing` again — so the
 * original run would match, overwrite the replacement's in-flight state and the
 * reclaim's bookkeeping, and then reject the replacement's own write as
 * superseded. The dead run wins and the live one loses, which is worse than the
 * unguarded last-write-wins it replaced.
 *
 * `syncLockToken` is written in the same CAS that takes the lock, so matching it
 * proves the lock is still this run's. `status` is kept alongside as defence in
 * depth and to cover a user pausing the connector mid-run.
 *
 * Guards every write a run makes to its own connector row: both terminal paths
 * and the mid-run heartbeat. The failure path needs it as much as the success
 * path — a reclaimed run's failure would double-increment a counter the sweep
 * already advanced and overwrite its backoff with a shorter one — and reusing it
 * for the heartbeat is what turns a beat into an ownership probe.

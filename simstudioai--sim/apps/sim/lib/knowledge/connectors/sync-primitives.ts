/**
 * Decides whether the sweep may reclaim one document — delete its embeddings,
 * reset it, and dispatch it again.
 *
 * Since document processing is dispatched to `knowledge-process-document`
 * rather than awaited inline, a document sits at `pending` from dispatch until
 * a worker claims it; `processing` is only written once a worker has actually
 * started. Reclaiming a `pending` document therefore risks racing a run that is
 * still queued, which both duplicates its work and bills a second indexing
 * pass, so queued documents get {@link QUEUED_DISPATCH_GRACE_MS} before they
 * are considered lost — the same grace the user-facing retry waits out before
 * it will admit a `pending` document.
 *
 * Queue wait is measured from `processingQueuedAt`, stamped in one place —
 * `markDocumentsQueued`, which every dispatch funnels through, so the column
 * always describes the attempt that is live right now.
 * It falls back to `uploadedAt` when NULL, which covers a document dispatched
 * by the sync that created it (`uploadedAt` then sits within that sync's own
 * runtime, an over-estimate bounded by the one-hour sync ceiling) and rows
 * written before the column existed.
 *
 * `failed` is not a terminal state and gets the same grace. `processDocumentAsync`
 * records the failure and then rethrows, so `knowledge-process-document` retries
 * it up to `maxAttempts` (3): between attempts the row reads `failed` while a
 * live run is scheduled to pick it up again. The gap between attempts is bounded
 * by the queue, not by run duration — a retried run re-enters the same queue
 * behind the same global concurrency limit — so `maxDuration` x `maxAttempts`
 * (30 minutes) and `STALE_PROCESSING_MINUTES` are both far too short to be safe
 * here: on the very backlog this grace exists for, the next attempt starts hours
 * after the last one ended. `failed` is therefore aged from
 * `processingCompletedAt`, the instant the last attempt ended, which every
 * failure write stamps.
 *
 * A document whose retries genuinely exhaust is still recovered: its final
 * failure stops moving `processingCompletedAt`, so one grace later it becomes
 * eligible and the next sync re-dispatches it. Recovery is delayed by the grace,
 * never lost. The user-facing retry stays immediate — it writes `pending` and
 * dispatches without consulting the sweep at all.
 *
 * The grace decides when a queued run may be superseded, but correctness does
 * not depend on that timing judgment. Every task carries the queue stamp its
 * dispatch installed and must match it before claiming or billing the row. A
 * sweep clears the abandoned stamp before installing a new one, so a late old
 * task declines while the replacement proceeds. Queue admission also claims
 * only an empty stamp, preventing concurrent callers from charging or enqueuing
 * two live generations for the same pending document.

 * 10% collapse threshold), and a change to a connector's externalId derivation,
 * which yields a complete, correct listing of entirely new keys — under which
 * every stored document is "absent" and every listed one is new.
 *
 * The hold is deliberately all-or-nothing rather than a truncation to the cap:
 * deleting up to the cap still destroys data, and leaves the knowledge base in a
 * state no operator asked for and no later sync can reason about. For the outage
 * shapes above the corpus is left intact and reconciliation resumes as soon as
 * the source returns its full listing. It does NOT self-heal from a hold caused
 * by genuine bulk removal: those deletions stay withheld until a `fullSync`
 * applies them, which is the point — a human confirms them.
 *
 * The two generations are capped SEPARATELY. Soft deletes are this sync's newly
 * absent documents; hard deletes are the previous generation's soft deletes,
 * confirmed absent a second time and therefore already gated by this cap once.
 * Summing them double-counts the older generation and, on a connector with
 * steady churn, ratchets: each sync's new soft deletes plus the prior sync's
 * pending hard deletes exceed the cap, the all-or-nothing hold blocks the hard
 * deletes that would drain the backlog, and the backlog grows monotonically so
 * the connector never reconciles again. Capping each generation against the same
 * ceiling keeps the per-sync blast radius bounded without that deadlock.
 *
 * Note the ceiling this yields: each generation may spend the cap independently,
 * so a single sync can remove up to 2x the cap — with the default ratio, about
 * half the corpus, not a quarter. That is deliberate. The two generations are
 * different populations: the hard deletes were already gated by this cap on the
 * sync that tombstoned them, and have been invisible ever since, so confirming
 * them costs no additional visible documents. The quarter-of-a-corpus figure
 * describes what one sync may newly hide, which is the number that matters for a
 * source that has started lying about its contents.
 *
 * `fullSync` bypasses the cap, matching its meaning everywhere else here — an
 * explicit human request to reconcile against this listing right now, which is
 * the documented escape hatch for a genuine mass deletion.

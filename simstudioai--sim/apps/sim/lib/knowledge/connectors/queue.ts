 * worker takes the lock there is otherwise nothing on the row distinguishing
 * "a sync is coming" from "idle", which is what previously forced the client to
 * guess from `createdAt`.
 *
 * `pending` is a phase of the same lock `syncing` holds, not a state beside it,
 * so it opens the lease and takes a token exactly as
 * {@link buildSyncLockAcquisition} does. The lease is what the scheduler ages a
 * stranded queue entry against — `updatedAt` cannot serve, because a pending
 * connector is still editable and every unrelated write to the row would renew
 * the recovery it is meant to trigger. The token is what makes the release
 * below provably this dispatch's own.
 *
 * Deliberately still writes an unowned row already `pending`. The create path is
 * born `pending` in its INSERT but carries no lease and no token, so skipping it
 * as a redundant write would leave every new connector ageing against
 * `updatedAt`. A pending row that already has a token is not taken again: that
 * token proves a hand-off already owns it, and replacing it would make the
 * queued task unable to acquire the lock.
 *
 * Takes the entry only from a status a run may start from — the same
 * {@link LOCKABLE_CONNECTOR_STATUSES} the lock acquisition uses, so queueing and
 * starting agree on one rule. The dispatch-side guards run before this write and
 * cannot see a status change that races it: without the allowlist, pausing a
 * connector in the window between "Sync now" being accepted and this UPDATE
 * landing would be silently overwritten back to `pending`. Returns `null` when
 * it takes nothing, so the caller can skip a hand-off that would only be refused
 * at the lock.

 * sync while the first is still writing, both racing the same documents.
 *
 * Measured against `COALESCE(syncLockLeaseAt, updatedAt)`, the lease a running
 * sync refreshes every {@link SYNC_LOCK_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS}. The lease is a
 * dedicated column precisely so an unrelated write to the row — a config edit on
 * a wedged connector — can no longer pass for a heartbeat; `updatedAt` remains
 * only as the fallback for a row locked before that column existed. That is what makes the TTL mean
 * "nobody is working on this" rather than "this started a long time ago" — the
 * distinction the in-process fallback path needs. A Trigger.dev run is killed at
 * {@link CONNECTOR_SYNC_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS} and so is provably dead well before
 * this; the fallback path has no duration cap, so without a heartbeat a large
 * self-hosted sync that legitimately runs past two hours would be reclaimed while
 * still working, counted as a failure, and — because its own terminal write is
 * then rejected as superseded — never able to reset that counter. Ten such syncs
 * would disable a connector whose every sync had actually succeeded.
 *
 * A run that stops heartbeating is genuinely gone: its process died, or it is
 * wedged, and either way reclaiming it is correct. The sweep's verdict stays
 * authoritative for those — `completeSyncLog` is guarded on `status = 'started'`
 * and terminal connector writes on the run's own `syncLockToken`, so a late
 * finisher loses the race by design rather than by accident.

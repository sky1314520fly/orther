 * different chat is picked up by nobody, and the turn used to park for the full
 * `timeoutMs` (an hour) before failing.
 *
 * After `graceMs` with no result, this competes for the same single-winner
 * execution claim that `/api/workflows/[id]/execute` takes on the browser's
 * behalf. Losing the claim means a browser really is running it, so we go back
 * to waiting; winning it means nobody was there, so we run it in-process.
 * Because both sides contend on `claimedBy IS NULL`, the workflow can never run
 * twice — a browser arriving late gets a 409 it already treats as benign.

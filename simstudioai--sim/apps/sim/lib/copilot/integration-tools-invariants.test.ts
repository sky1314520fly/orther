/**
 * Sweeps the real registry for the invariant the permission gate depends on.
 *
 * A permission group's `deniedTools` holds the ids an admin sees in the access
 * control grid, which are exactly the owning block's `tools.access` entries.
 * The gate compares ids verbatim, so if an exposed tool were ever published
 * under an id its block does not declare — a `_v2` superseding a still-declared
 * v1, say — denying the declared id would leave the exposed one advertised and
 * callable. Pin it here so that authoring mistake fails at CI rather than
 * silently widening what a governed workspace can reach.

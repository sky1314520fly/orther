 * The single definition of how a docs source file maps onto its public path.

 * Fumadocs folds a section's `index.mdx` into the section URL itself, so
 * `workflows/index.mdx` on disk is `/workflows` on the site (and
 * `/workflows/index.mdx` is a 404). Three places need that rule — the manifest
 * generator, the `source_document` -> VFS reverse mapping, and the vector
 * search's scope filter — and hand-syncing it has bitten this repo before, so
 * it lives here.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: `scripts/sync-docs-manifest.ts` imports this by
 * relative path, and it must not pull in the manifest it generates.

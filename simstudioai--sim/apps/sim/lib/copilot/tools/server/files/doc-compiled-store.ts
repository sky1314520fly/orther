 * Compiled-artifact store for Python-generated documents.

 * The Python doc path keeps the SOURCE as the primary file (the agent reads and
 * edits it exactly like the JS path). The compiled binary is stored as its own
 * S3 object, content-addressed by (workspaceId, sha256(source + referenced-input identity), ext) —
 * the hash is in the key, so source or referenced-file content changes invalidate the artifact. Every read path
 * (serve, preview, /compiled) loads the artifact for the current source hash and
 * recompiles only when it is absent. No fileId in the key means any site with
 * the source (e.g. the serve route) can find it. S3 is cheap; stale artifacts
 * are inert.

/**
 * Loads the compiled binary for the current source, or null if not yet built.

 * The artifact is what a download or a public share actually serves, and it is read
 * separately from the source — so a source that cleared its own ceiling says nothing
 * about the size of this. Bounding it here rather than on the finished response is
 * what keeps an oversized artifact from being materialized before it is refused.
 *
 * The bound is the WIDEST ceiling any consumer of this funnel allows, because it is a
 * memory backstop and not a policy: a consumer that permits less enforces its own
 * limit on what it got back (the workspace download path holds artifacts to
 * `MAX_RENDERED_DOCUMENT_BYTES`, half of this). Using the tighter figure here instead
 * would reject artifacts the serving routes are willing to return.
 *
 * A size breach is rethrown rather than folded into `null`: null means "not built
 * yet", which callers answer with "still being prepared, try again", and an artifact
 * that is too large would retry forever behind that.

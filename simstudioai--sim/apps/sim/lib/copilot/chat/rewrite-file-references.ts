 * a message can only reference files that existed when it was written, every
 * chat-owned file is stamped with the user message of the turn it was born in
 * (NULL-stamped legacy rows are copied into every fork), and the fork copies
 * every chat-owned file born at-or-before the cut — so any chat-owned file a
 * kept message references is always in the maps. The only reachable leftovers
 * are files soft-deleted before the fork, whose links are equally dead in the
 * source chat.

/**
 * Top-level path segments served by the `app/(landing)` route group, plus the
 * root. The single source of truth for "is this the marketing surface", because
 * a route group is not a path prefix and nothing else can derive the answer.
 *
 * Two consumers depend on this list being complete, and both fail silently when
 * it is not:
 *
 * - `next.config.ts` exempts these paths from COEP. The header is a *document*
 *   header inherited across client-side navigations, so an unlisted landing page
 *   stays cross-origin isolated when it soft-navigates into `/demo`, where the
 *   Cal.com booker then loads uncredentialed and hangs forever.
 * - `ThemeProvider` forces the light theme on these paths, matching the `light`
 *   token layer `LandingShell` renders. Leave one out and `<html>` keeps the
 *   visitor's dark theme under a light page: root-level chrome (scrollbars,
 *   `color-scheme`, anything portalled to `<body>`) renders dark against it.
 *
 * Imported by `next.config.ts` before the `@/` alias resolves, so this module
 * must stay dependency-free.
 *
 * Add every new `app/(landing)` route here.

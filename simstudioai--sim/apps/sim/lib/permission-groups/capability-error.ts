/**
 * The caller's permission group withholds a capability the request needs.
 *
 * Carries the capability so a log line or an audit entry can name it; the
 * message names it for the caller. The detail code comes from the capability's
 * own rule rather than being fixed here — the closed code set is closed over
 * remedies, so the handful of capabilities with a remedy of their own (a chat
 * auth mode, public sharing, personal API keys) carry a code of their own and
 * the rest share the generic one.
 *
 * Lives here rather than beside the authorization funnel so the assertion
 * helpers can throw it without importing the funnel, which imports them.

 * recoverable. `archiveChildren` hooks walk resources one at a time through their canonical
 * delete, so a mid-loop failure can leave some children archived and some not. With the
 * folder already stamped, `deleteFolder` reuses that same `deletedAt` on the retry and the
 * stragglers join the original snapshot. Stamping children first would leave the folder
 * active, so a retry would mint a fresh timestamp and the partially-archived children could
 * never be matched by any restore again.
 *
 * The cost is a window where the folder reads as deleted while a resource inside it is still
 * active. That is the strictly better failure: it is transient and self-healing on retry,
 * where the alternative silently and permanently strands data.

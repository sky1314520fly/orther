The caller does only see the function's declared Input/Response schema, not its internal steps or credentials, and Workato's own marketing copy states 'update the function once, and the changes will take effect anywhere your function is invoked' (i.e. it always calls the live function recipe, not a frozen copy).

Community connectors can also be published open-source (installable, viewable, and modifiable by anyone) or closed-source.

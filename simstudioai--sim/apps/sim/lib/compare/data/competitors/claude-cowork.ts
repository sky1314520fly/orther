Anthropic's error reference describes only two outcomes for a failure: transient errors (server 5xx, overload, timeouts, dropped connections) are automatically retried up to 10 times with exponential backoff, and the run continues if a retry succeeds; once retries are exhausted, the error surfaces and the in-flight turn halts, requiring the user to retry the request or use /rewind to step back to an earlier checkpoint and resume manually.",

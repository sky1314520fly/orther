Users describe desired functionality or import existing React, Replit, or GitHub code, and Retool generates production‑ready apps with built‑in enterprise security, access controls, and audit logging. The platform connects directly to any database, API, or LLM, leveraging existing permissions for data access. Features include a prompt‑driven app builder, MCP server for AI coding agents, and import tools for legacy codebases. Retool’s governance framework lets business teams move fast while IT retains visibility, and the product is used by finance, manufacturing, logistics, and other data‑intensive organizations.',

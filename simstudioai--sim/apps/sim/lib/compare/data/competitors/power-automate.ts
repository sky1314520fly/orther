The scripting actions in Power Automate for desktop do accept externally supplied dependencies (the Run Python script action takes "Module folder paths", documented as "the paths of folders where external Python modules lie", and Run .NET script takes a "References to be loaded" root path for .dll files), but the Python version is limited to a choice of 2.7 or 3.4, dependencies must be pre-staged on disk rather than declared as a package manifest, and those actions run on a customer-managed Windows machine rather than in a managed cloud runtime.',

That is assembly-level extension of a locally installed runtime rather than a declarative package/system-package manifest for a hosted sandbox.

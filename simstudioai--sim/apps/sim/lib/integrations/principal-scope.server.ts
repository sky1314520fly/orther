 * credential-provider catalog and the block/tool catalog — and the interesting
 * case is the one that is easy to get wrong twice: a workspace API key carries
 * no user, so there is no permission group to read, and the allowlist collapses
 * to the deployment's own. Two copies of that reasoning would disagree the
 * first time either changed, and the two endpoints describe the same
 * integrations.
 *
 * Server-only: `resolvePermissionGroupConfig` reads the database.

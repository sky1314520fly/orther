/**
 * Durable stores that can hand a run a value whose secret provenance was never recorded.
 *
 * Named by the call site rather than derived, so the surface survives refactors and stays
 * greppable — the same convention the projection-refusal `site` strings use.
 *
 * One policy governs all of them: an **absence** — nobody recorded what these bytes carry — may be
 * read, with an audit entry naming the surface, because a value nobody recorded says exactly what
 * an untracked one does. A **taint** — a writer that knew secrets were present and could not map
 * them to this output — is refused, and no policy relaxes it.
 *
 * Only `workspace-file` stores the difference, and that is deliberate rather than drift. On the
 * other surfaces every non-exact sidecar comes from one condition, an incomplete incoming bundle
 * or registry, which is always an absence; two stored statuses say everything there is to say.
 * Files are the only surface that derives one stored object from another — an archive extracted
 * into children, a generated asset, a transcoded output — so they are the only one that can refuse
 * on purpose, and the only one with two claims to keep apart. Adding a third status elsewhere would
 * encode a distinction that surface cannot make; removing it here would collapse one that matters.

 * True when unrecorded provenance from this surface must fail the run rather than warn.
 *
 * Nothing is enforced by default. `unknown` provenance means "nobody recorded what secrets this
 * value carries", which is the same thing a pre-tracking legacy row says — and legacy rows are read
 * as carrying none. Enforcing one and not the other made an *aware* writer that momentarily could
 * not vouch strictly worse than an unaware one: the row it wrote latched every run that later read
 * it, and each latched run wrote more such rows, so a workspace could not recover without a data
 * repair.
 *
 * Warning instead keeps that state visible and measurable while the writers that produce it are
 * fixed. The sidecar still records `unknown` faithfully, so a surface can be closed back up once
 * its writers stop losing provenance — and the rows that will start failing are countable from the
 * sidecar table before the switch is thrown. This is a deliberate posture: an unenforced surface
 * can under-redact a value whose provenance was lost.
 *
 * Set `DURABLE_SECRET_PROVENANCE_ENFORCED_SURFACES` to `all`, or to a comma-separated subset of
 * {@link DURABLE_SECRET_PROVENANCE_SURFACES}, to close a surface.
 *
 * Workspace files were held out of this list while their fail-closed posture was its own decision.
 * That decision arrived as broken state: because a file that was never tracked already reads as
 * exact-empty, refusing only the file whose provenance could not be recorded made a writer that
 * momentarily could not vouch permanently worse off than one that never tried — with no way back,
 * since nothing rewrites a file's provenance but another content write. Live files across several
 * workspaces sat unreadable behind it, by every tool route at once, carrying exactly as much
 * information about their contents as the untracked files beside them: none.

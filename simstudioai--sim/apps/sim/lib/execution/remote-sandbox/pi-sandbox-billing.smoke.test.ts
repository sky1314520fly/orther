/**
 * @vitest-environment node
 *
 * Checks that a Pi session's sandbox is actually metered against a real provider.
 *
 * The handler-level test mocks the backend and writes into the sink by hand, so
 * it proves the wiring from a backend to the block's cost and nothing else. It
 * would still pass if `withPiSandbox` never metered at all — which is exactly
 * the bug this path had. Only a real Pi sandbox shows that creation is metered,
 * that teardown reports, and that the amount tracks the session's real lifetime.
 *
 * Enable with `SANDBOX_BILLING_SMOKE=1`, against whichever provider
 * `SANDBOX_PROVIDER` selects. Needs that provider's Pi image configured
 * (`E2B_PI_TEMPLATE_ID` / `DAYTONA_PI_SNAPSHOT_ID`).

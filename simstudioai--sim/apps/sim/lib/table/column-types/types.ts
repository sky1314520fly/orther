/**
 * The shape of a table column type.
 *
 * Everything that varies per column type — how it looks, how it stores, how it
 * coerces, how it compares in SQL — lives on one of these, so adding a type is
 * "write one file and register it" rather than finding ~40 `switch` arms.
 *
 * Split in two, on the axis that actually constrains us:
 *
 * - {@link ColumnTypeDefinition} is **client-safe**. It may carry a React icon
 *   (an icon is a component *reference*; server code never calls it, and
 *   `scripts/check-client-boundary-imports.ts` only forbids calling a
 *   `'use client'` export from a server surface). It must NOT reach `@sim/db`,
 *   `drizzle-orm`, or `next/server` — the tables grid imports it directly.
 * - `ColumnTypeServerDefinition` (in `types.server.ts`) adds the one genuinely
 *   server-only concern: rewriting stored cells inside a transaction.
 *
 * This mirrors `connectors/types.ts`'s `ConnectorMeta` / `ConnectorConfig`
 * split and its `registry.ts` / `registry.server.ts` pair.

/**
 * Fractional order keys for table-row ordering.
 *
 * A row's order is a base-62 string key, not an integer position. Inserting
 * between two rows mints a key strictly between their keys, so no other row's
 * key changes — insert and delete become O(1) (no position reshift / recompact).
 *
 * Thin wrapper over the in-house fractional-indexing port (Figma/rocicorp
 * algorithm) so the implementation is swappable. Keys never run out
 * (variable-length strings); the only cost is gradual length growth under
 * repeated same-spot inserts.

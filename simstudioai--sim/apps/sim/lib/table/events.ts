/**
 * Per-table event buffer for live cell-state updates.
 *
 * The grid subscribes to a per-table SSE stream and patches its React Query cache
 * as events arrive. This is a thin domain adapter over the generic durable event
 * log (`@/lib/realtime/event-log`): it owns the Redis key prefix (`table:stream:`)
 * and the entry wire shape (`{ eventId, tableId, event }`), and gets append/read/
 * tail + replay + prune semantics from the core. Every status transition appends
 * here with a monotonic eventId; SSE clients resume on reconnect via
 * `?from=<lastEventId>` and the server replays from this buffer.
 *
 * The `table:stream:` prefix and the entry shape are a wire contract — renaming
 * the prefix resets the seq counter and silently strands connected clients (their
 * in-memory `lastEventId` no longer matches), so both are intentionally fixed here.

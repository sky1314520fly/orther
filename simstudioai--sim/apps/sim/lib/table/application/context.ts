 * the assertion and reports any mismatch as `not_found`. The table outcome is inspected first and
 * unconditionally, so on every path that returns, the assertion has been *proven* equal to the
 * canonical workspace id — the context handed back is the table's own workspace, never a
 * workspace the caller merely named. A mismatch throws before the workspace outcome is read, so a
 * failing workspace load can never replace the concealing `not_found`. `Promise.allSettled` keeps
 * the branch that is thrown away from surfacing as an unhandled rejection. A final identity check
 * on the loaded context restates the invariant at the point of return, so the value handed back is
 * only ever a context whose own `workspaceId` is the table's.
 *
 * Without an asserted id there is nothing to start early — the table load is what reveals which
 * workspace to load — so that path stays sequential.

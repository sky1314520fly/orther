/**
 * Per-table mutation-lock enforcement — four independent locks, one per verb.
 *
 * Lives at the `lib/table` service layer, not the routes: Mothership calls these
 * services directly, so route-level asserts would miss it entirely.
 *
 * Non-goals, each load-bearing:
 * - Do NOT re-read the table inside a write tx to close the TOCTOU window. A
 *   `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the definition row reintroduces the per-insert
 *   serialization hotspot migration 0198 removed; `getTableById` without `{ tx }`
 *   takes a second pool connection while holding the first (the billing
 *   pool-starvation shape). Locks gate *starting* a mutation, not a transactional
 *   fence — workspace `write` is still the security boundary.
 * - Integrity, not confidentiality: reads/exports are never blocked, and forking
 *   (admin-gated, the same bar as unlocking) resets locks on the copy.
 * - System writers outside these helpers (fork copy, workspace archive,
 *   soft-delete GC, order-key repair, seeds) must keep writing raw so they are
 *   never blocked.

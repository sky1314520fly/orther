/**
 * Instance-tier organization: one organization that every user on a deployment

 * Org-scoped enterprise features — whitelabeling, PII redaction, permission
 * groups, data drains, audit scoping — resolve their settings from a
 * workspace's `organizationId`. A deployment where everyone works in personal
 * workspaces has no organization for those features to read, so enabling them
 * appears to do nothing. Setting `INSTANCE_ORG_NAME` turns on this mode: the
 * organization is provisioned on first use, every new user joins it, and their
 * workspaces are created org-owned.
 *
 * Only meaningful without billing. With billing on, organizations are created
 * and paid for through the normal subscription flow, so this module stays

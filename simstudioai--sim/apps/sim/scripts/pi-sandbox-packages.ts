/**
 * The single source of truth for what goes into the Pi sandbox image.
 *
 * Two renderers consume these lists:
 *   - `build-pi-e2b-template.ts`      — E2B template, via the `Template()` builder DSL
 *   - `build-pi-daytona-snapshot.ts`  — Daytona snapshot, via the `Image` builder
 *
 * A package added here reaches both providers. Adding one to only a single
 * renderer is the drift that makes a failover fail at the worst moment.
 *
 * The copilot repo holds the equivalent lists for the shell and doc sandboxes
 * (`copilot/scripts/sandbox/packages.ts`); the Pi image lives here because Sim

/**
 * vCPU and RAM for the Pi sandbox, shared for the same reason the package lists
 * are: the two providers had already drifted here. Daytona asked for 4 CPU / 8 GB
 * while the E2B template asked for nothing and inherited its base default of
 * 2 vCPU / 512 MB — a 16x memory gap between the provider Pi normally runs on and
 * the one it fails over to, which would surface as the agent being killed on E2B
 * for work that succeeded on Daytona.
 *
 * 512 MB is the real problem: the Pi CLI is a Node process holding an LLM
 * context, running beside a `git clone` of the user's repository, and Node has no
 * graceful behaviour at that ceiling — it is OOM-killed, which reaches the user
 * as an opaque agent failure rather than a diagnosable one.
 *
 * Both numbers are at E2B's Professional maximum (8 vCPU / 8192 MB per build,
 * 1 vCPU / 512 MB minimum). Sizing is per-second billed against allocated
 * resources rather than used ones, so this costs roughly 3x the previous E2B
 * default per sandbox-second. On the compute-bound phases that is close to
 * neutral — the work finishes proportionally sooner — but Babysit deliberately
 * idles between review polls, and idle seconds bill at the same rate. Lower
 * {@link PI_SANDBOX_CPU_COUNT} first if that idle time proves dominant: vCPU is
 * ~3x the hourly rate of a GB of RAM, and RAM is the dimension that prevents
 * hard failures.

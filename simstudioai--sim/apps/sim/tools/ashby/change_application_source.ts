     * endpoint has no "leave unchanged" mode, so setting and clearing are the
     * only two intents, and exactly one of them must be expressed:
     *
     * - neither given: an omitted sourceId would otherwise wipe attribution on a
     *   real application and still report success
     * - both given: preferring either one silently discards the other, which is
     *   how "clear this" turns into a set nobody asked for
     *
     * Both are caller errors rather than something to resolve by precedence.

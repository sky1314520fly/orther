/**
 * Traversal-safe construction of URL path components from tool parameters.
 *
 * The rule these helpers encode, stated once for the whole module: **no
 * encoding scheme neutralizes a dot segment — only value rejection does.**
 *
 * `.` and `..` are *unreserved* characters, so `encodeURIComponent('..')`
 * returns `'..'` verbatim. Double-encoding does not help either, because the
 * WHATWG URL parser that `fetch` uses removes the percent-encoded spellings of
 * a dot segment (`%2e`, `%2E`, and every mixed spelling of the two-dot form)
 * just as it removes the literal one:
 *
 * ```
 * new URL('https://x/v1/a/b/..').pathname     // => '/v1/a/'
 * new URL('https://x/v1/a/b/%2e%2e').pathname // => '/v1/a/'  (still removed)
 * ```
 *
 * Only the literal spellings need checking here, and that is not a shortcut:
 * `encodeURIComponent` escapes `%` itself, so a value whose literal text is
 * `%2e%2e` leaves as `%252e%252e` and no encoded spelling can ever be emitted.
 * The check is sufficient *because* every value goes through
 * `encodeURIComponent` — a pass-through for pre-encoded input would have to
 * widen it.
 *
 * A removed segment pops a path segment on a fixed host with the caller's
 * bearer token still attached — including on DELETE routes. These parameters
 * are typically `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`, so prompt injection controls them.
 * Therefore a value that is exactly `.` or `..` after trimming is rejected
 * outright rather than encoded, and no helper here may be "simplified" back to
 * a bare encode.
 *
 * A dot *inside* a longer segment is legitimate and preserved untouched:
 * `example.com`, `my-app.vercel.app`, `..foo`, and `foo..` all pass through.

/**
 * Normalizes an incoming parameter to a string before it is guarded.
 *
 * Trimming is left to the caller, because whether surrounding whitespace is
 * copy-paste noise or part of the value is a per-helper decision.
 *
 * Tool params are declared `type: 'string'`, but that declaration is not
 * enforced anywhere before the value reaches here: it arrives from an LLM tool
 * call or from stored workflow state, where a numeric-looking id (a Vercel
 * `deploymentId`, a Daytona `sandboxId`) can be serialized as a JSON **number**
 * and stays one. The previous `typeof value === 'string' ? value.trim() : ''`
 * turned any such value into `''`, which the guards then reported as
 * *"<param> is required"* — the least actionable message available for a value
 * the caller did supply, and one that points at the wrong fix.
 *
 * This is not a restoration of prior behaviour. Every call site that predates
 * these guards interpolated `${params.id.trim()}`, so a numeric id threw
 * `TypeError: params.id.trim is not a function` there too. The widening is a
 * deliberate improvement: it accepts what callers actually send, and where it
 * still refuses (below) it says why by name.
 *
 * An id too large for a `double` — a Discord snowflake, a Twitter id — is
 * **not** in scope here and cannot be: `JSON.parse` destroys the precision
 * before this function is ever reached (`1234567890123456789` becomes
 * `1234567890123456800`). Such an id must arrive as a **string**; nothing this
 * function does can recover one that did not.
 *
 * The accepted set is therefore narrow on purpose — `string`, `number`, and
 * `bigint`, and nothing else. A bare `String(value)` would coerce every other
 * shape into a *plausible but wrong* segment (`{}` into
 * `'%5Bobject%20Object%5D'`, `true` into `'true'`, `[1,2]` into `'1%2C2'`,
 * `new Date(0)` into a 60-character encoded date), producing a 404 from the
 * provider instead of a named error from us. Rejecting them keeps the failure
 * legible and attributable to the caller's input.
 *
 * Three number spellings are rejected even though `typeof` says `'number'`,
 * because their decimal text is not the id the caller meant:
 *
 * - Non-finite (`NaN`, `±Infinity`) — no identifier reading at all.
 * - An integer beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, whose decimal text has already
 *   lost digits. That is silent corruption of a large id, which is exactly the
 *   failure mode a caller cannot debug from a 404. Every value large enough to
 *   print exponentially (`1e21` → `'1e+21'`) is an integer double and lands
 *   here, so it keeps this precision message.
 * - A value whose `String()` is exponential without being imprecise — only the
 *   *tiny* magnitudes reach this (`1e-7`, `5e-324`). These do round-trip
 *   exactly, so the precision complaint would be false; they are rejected on
 *   the separate ground that `1e-7` is not a spelling any provider path
 *   accepts as an identifier, and emitting `/v1/trends/1e-7` would rewrite the
 *   caller's `0.0000001` into text they never wrote. The error says so.
 *
 * A plain decimal such as `1.5` is kept: it round-trips through `String`
 * exactly and reads as written, so it is the caller's value verbatim.
 *
 * `null` and `undefined` are rejected *first* and keep the distinct *"is
 * required"* message, because `String(null)` is the truthy `'null'` — coercing
 * would silently address a resource literally named `"null"` — and because
 * "you sent nothing" is a different fix for the caller than "you sent the
 * wrong kind of thing". The type check also runs before any stringification,
 * so an `Object.create(null)` produces this module's named error rather than a
 * bare `TypeError` with the parameter name lost.

/**
 * SubBlockState stores values for all subblocks in workflows.
 *
 * Architecture: values deliberately live here, split from the workflow store's
 * block structure, so per-keystroke edits do not re-render the canvas graph.
 * The structure keeps a copy of each value from hydration time only — it goes
 * stale as soon as a value is edited (except condition/router dynamic-handle
 * subblocks, which dual-write the structure because edge handles derive from
 * it). Whenever full state is needed (change detection, export, manual runs,
 * diffs), mergeSubblockState/mergeSubblockStateWithValues joins this store
 * onto the structure.
 *
 * Value semantics at that join (single source of truth for the contract):
 * - Key present with any value, including null: this store wins. Null means
 *   the user explicitly cleared the field — it must NOT fall back to the
 *   structure's stale copy, or cleared fields resurrect in comparisons and
 *   serialization while the DB (correctly) holds null.
 * - Key absent or undefined: no value recorded; the structure's value stands.
 * - initializeFromWorkflow seeds every structure key (nulls included) at
 *   hydration, so post-hydration "present with null" is always meaningful.
 *
 * Persistence: user-authored edits flow through collaborativeSetSubblockValue,
 * which updates this store and queues the identical value to the realtime
 * server — the client's merged state and the DB draft stay equivalent, which
 * is what keeps deploy-time change detection honest (deploy snapshots the DB
 * draft). Direct setValue callers do not persist, and each is safe for a
 * different reason:
 *
 * - remote-broadcast application — already persisted server-side
 * - undo/redo — persists via its own queued inverse operations
 * - synthetic tool subblock ids — excluded from both persistence and comparison
 * - whole-document replacement — the server's own state, re-seeded
 * - webhook management's runtime ids (webhookId/triggerPath/triggerConfig/
 *   triggerId) — excluded by filterSubBlockIds
 * - populateTriggerFieldsFromConfig — writes deploy-materialized defaults, which
 *   the canonical form resolves to the same value on both sides
 *
 * That last entry previously claimed `normalizeTriggerConfigValues` compensated
 * for it. It never could: that helper back-fills from a side's OWN persisted
 * `triggerConfig` aggregate, nothing has persisted one since the modal-era
 * migration, and it only fills keys that already exist — while the divergence it
 * was supposed to cancel is a key that does not. Roughly half of all deployed
 * webhooks carried a phantom "Update" because of it. The compensation is now
 * `canonicalizeSubBlockValue`, which resolves a blank value and a value equal to
 * its declared default to the same thing on both sides of the comparison.
 *
 * Adding a new direct caller means adding a line above. If it writes an id the
 * comparison reads, and nothing here explains why that is safe, it is not.

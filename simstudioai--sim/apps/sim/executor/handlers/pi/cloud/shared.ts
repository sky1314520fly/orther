 * and authoring has three commands around the agent turn: the clone before it,
 * then the commit and push after it, the last two sharing
 * {@link FINALIZE_TIMEOUT_MS}. Plan has no finalize phase and sets that reserve
 * to zero. Capping at the bare lifetime would mean the sandbox died first.
 *
 * Takes the lifetime as an argument rather than reading the provider ceiling
 * itself, because that ceiling is no longer the only lifetime a run can get: a
 * caller that narrowed it to the execution deadline has to reserve against the
 * lifetime it actually asked for, or it re-opens exactly the bug above on every
 * plan whose deadline is shorter than the ceiling.
 *
 * What is reserved is each command's timeout ceiling, not its measured elapsed
 * time — a clone takes seconds in practice — so this is a budget that adds up,
 * not a guarantee that the sandbox outlives the run.
 *
 * Both adapters impose an absolute lifetime: E2B through `timeoutMs` and Daytona

 * what runs. Both sandbox images apt-install git on Debian (see

 * reduces rather than removes exposure — every sandbox command runs as root, so
 * the binary itself is writable too.

 * default-shell behavior cannot change whether an upstream Pi failure reaches the caller.

 * With no options the repository resources Pi loads are exactly what Create PR always had. With an

 * the explicit `-e` path loaded, so the loaded set is exactly Sim's own extension. That is deliberate —
 * a repository must not be able to register tools into a run holding the workspace's keys — but it
 * does mean enabling search also stops loading a repository's own Pi extensions, which is why the
 * flag is not passed on Create PR's no-search path. Babysit supplies

/**
 * Model, provider-key, and cost resolution shared by Pi backends. Local Dev
 * mirrors the Agent block — keys resolve through `getApiKeyWithBYOK`, so a
 * Sim-hosted key may be used and billed. Review Code has the same host-side key
 * boundary. Create PR, Update PR, and Plan require the user's own key (the
 * block's API Key field, or a stored BYOK key) because those modes run the model
 * client in an untrusted sandbox. Cost uses the billing multiplier and is zeroed
 * for BYOK / non-billable models.
 *
 * `getBYOKKey` resolves the workspace pool first and falls back to the
 * organization's, so the key handed to the sandbox may be one the workspace
 * never stored and that its siblings share. That is a deliberate consequence of
 * organization BYOK — an organization that does not want its key reachable from
 * a sandbox gives the workspace its own key for that provider, which always
 * wins. The BYOK settings page says so where the key is entered.
 *
 * Optional web search is keyed separately and more strictly: the block field
 * only, never a stored key and never a Sim-hosted one, in every mode.

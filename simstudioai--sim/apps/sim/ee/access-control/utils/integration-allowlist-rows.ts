 * The stored `allowedIntegrations` re-expressed as editor rows: successor-

 * rows the editor actually offers. `null` stays `null` — everything allowed.
 *
 * A stored list can name a retired id (written before the universe excluded
 * superseded blocks, or through the API directly). The runtime resolves it to
 * its successor, so a stored `slack` allows `slack_v2`; reading the raw strings
 * would render that row unchecked, and toggling it would "enable" an
 * integration that was already permitted. Resolving first makes the checkbox
 * tell the truth, and the projection drops the stale id on the next write.

 * skill/markdown bodies are intentionally left as graceful broken links rather than mutated.
 *
 * The deployed-version sweep covers the draft-affected workflows UNION this sync's deployed

 * fill window), so scoping to draft divergence alone would miss it.
 *

 * a cleanup error never aborts the others. The placeholder drop is SKIPPED when a reference-clear
 * phase threw - dropping it then would turn an empty placeholder into a dangling reference to a
 * deleted row; leaving it keeps the reference resolvable (to empty content) until a later retry.
 *
 * Returns `{ cleared, clearingFailed }` for the fork activity metadata. `clearingFailed` is true
 * when a reference-clear phase threw - placeholders were then NOT dropped - and `cleared` is 0 in
 * that case, so the report never claims references it did not actually clear. On success `cleared`
 * is the count of failed resources whose references were cleared.
 *
 * Storage accounting: this cleanup never decrements storage usage because it never removes
 * anything that remains counted. A failed file copy is not charged and leaves its metadata row
 * re-uploadable. A failed KB copy reverses its usage and retires its active file-ownership rows
 * before reaching this cleanup; deterministic blobs remain available for a safe retry.

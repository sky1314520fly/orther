/**
 * Remap the workflow/block references embedded in a copied table's schema so its
 * workflow groups keep working in the child workspace. `workflowGroups[].workflowId`
 * is rewritten through the source→child workflow identity map, and each
 * `outputs[].blockId` is rewritten through `resolveBlockId` - which MUST be the
 * same resolver that assigns the target workflows' block ids, or the outputs
 * point at nonexistent blocks. Fork-create omits it and defaults to the
 * deterministic {@link deriveForkBlockId} (a fresh child has no persisted
 * pairs, matching `copyWorkflowStateIntoTarget`); promote passes its
 * persisted-pair resolver (a push keeps the parent's ORIGINAL block ids, which
 * never equal the derive). Manual groups whose backing workflow was not
 * copied are dropped, and any columns wired to a dropped group have their
 * `workflowGroupId` cleared. Enrichment groups (empty `workflowId`) and column
 * ids are left untouched.

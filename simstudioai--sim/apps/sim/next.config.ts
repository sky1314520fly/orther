     *
     * Measured locally on `/workspace/[workspaceId]/w`, n=3 per cell, restarting
     * the dev server between each run:
     *
     *   cache OFF   31.4s / 30.1s / 31.9s   RSS ~9.0-9.8 GB
     *   cache ON     5.7s /  6.1s /  5.7s   RSS ~4.8-5.1 GB
     *
     * 5.4x faster restarts and ~1.9x less memory. Cold compile with an empty
     * cache is unchanged (~32s either way) — the cache only pays back on restart.
     *
     * This is deliberately NOT the same decision as `turbopackFileSystemCacheForBuild`
     * below. That one is measured-harmful for `next build`; this one is
     * measured-beneficial for `next dev`. It was previously `false`, but that was

     * description never mentions Turbopack, caching, or dev performance, and it
     * is not covered by the #6078 build A/B cited below.
     *
     * The cache is unbounded on disk (an abandoned one reached 78 GB here), so
     * `scripts/prune-turbopack-cache.ts` is chained into every `dev` script to cap it.
     * A *corrupted* cache can abort Turbopack outright ("Cache corruption
     * detected: checksum mismatch") rather than falling back — it depends whether
     * the damaged region is read. `bun run dev:clean` and restart is the fix.
     *
     * If you re-measure any of this: `next dev` compiles routes on demand, so
     * startup time means nothing — time the first request to a route, restart the
     * server between runs, and stop it with SIGINT. A `kill -9` mid-write makes
     * Turbopack discard the partially-written cache and rebuild silently, which

 * attempt record — which the chat tab's chip picks up over its storage
 * listener — then closes the window. Renders nothing, so the page's frame
 * paints as server markup before this hydrates.
 *
 * Reaching this page IS the verdict: Better Auth routes a flow here only as its
 * success `callbackURL`, sending failures to `/oauth-error` or back here with
 * an `error` code. That beats diffing the credential list, which calls a
 * re-authorized account a failure — that path updates the existing account row
 * and creates nothing for a diff to find.
 *
 * A window the browser refuses to close redirects to the chat instead (the
 * popup-blocked path opens this leg in a tab, which no script may close). That
 * URL carries no attempt id on purpose: the verdict is already published, and
 * the destination would otherwise re-decide it by the very diff above.

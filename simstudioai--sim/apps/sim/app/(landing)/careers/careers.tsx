/**
 * The careers page — a mission-led hero above the live open-roles board. Roles
 * are pulled from Sim's public Ashby job board at build/revalidate time
 * ({@link getAshbyJobs}) and server-rendered in full, so every posting is in the
 * crawlable HTML; the interactive {@link JobBoard} hydrates on top to add
 * Team/Location filtering.
 *
 * Both sections share the landing gutter — capped and centered at `max-w-[1460px]`
 * with the navbar-aligned `px-20 max-lg:px-8 max-sm:px-5` so the headline starts on
 * the same vertical line as the wordmark. The hero carries the single `<h1>`
 * (containing "Sim" and "AI workspace") plus an sr-only product summary for AI
 * citation (landing CLAUDE.md → GEO); the roles section owns its own `<h2>`.
 *
 * Because {@link JobBoard} reads the URL via nuqs (`useSearchParams`), it sits under
 * a `<Suspense>` boundary. The page parses the same `?team=`/`?location=` query on
 * the server ({@link careersSearchParamsCache}) and pre-filters the fallback to
 * match, so a deep-linked filter renders the correct roles server-side — the list
 * never flashes unfiltered before the client board hydrates.

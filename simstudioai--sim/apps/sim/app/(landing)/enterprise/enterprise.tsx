/**
 * Enterprise landing page (`/enterprise`) - the flagship surface for teams
 * evaluating Sim as their enterprise AI agent platform.
 *
 * Structurally it mirrors {@link SolutionsPage} (hero → logos → card rows →
 * shared homepage CTA) but composes its own `<main>` so the hero can render
 * full-bleed in its `home` variant. The four feature rows render through
 * {@link EnterpriseFeatureGrid} - one shared grid that regroups the 12 cards
 * into 4/4/2/2 in the two-column band so no section leaves an orphan cell.
 * The shared `SOLUTIONS_SPACING` constants own the enterprise content gutter
 * and inter-section rhythm, while the homepage {@link Cta} owns the closing
 * conversion band.
 *
 * The strict heading outline is H1 (hero) → H2 (each card row + the CTA) → H3
 * (each card), never skipped. Server Component; the interactive leaves live in
 * the shared landing components.

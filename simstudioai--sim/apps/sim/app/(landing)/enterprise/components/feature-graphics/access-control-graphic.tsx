 * Workspace access told as a vertical role graph, with no window framing:
 * three gradient-circle team avatars across the top flow down through
 * curved node-graph edges — 1px bezier strokes in the deploy tile's faint
 * guide-line grey, each bending toward and landing on the specific
 * permission chip that team holds — so who-can-do-what reads as directed
 * wiring. Scopes narrow across the teams (Engineering builds, reviews, and
 * deploys; Support builds and reviews; Ops reviews). Engineering's Deploy
 * grant is the emphasized element: its curve carries the stronger
 * `--text-secondary` ink into a filled junction node that blooms the row's
 * shared 6s ring pulse; the other chips sit behind quiet hollow
 * port nodes and mono chips (fills stepped up to `--surface-6` so the
 * pills stay legible on the grey ground).
 *
 * Motion (from `access-control-graphic.module.css`, one shared 6s cycle):
 * the edges draw in with a dash-normalized stroke sweep (`pathLength=1`,
 * the deploy tile's pattern), staggered so the grants wire up one after
 * another — quiet edges first, the emphasized Deploy edge last — then
 * hold drawn for the rest of the loop, and the grant node's ring pulse
 * blooms as the emphasized edge lands. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the
 * graph renders fully drawn and static.
 *
 * The avatar assets are grey radial gradients on a black square, so each
 * sits in a `rounded-full overflow-hidden` clip with a slight scale-up to
 * crop the black canvas past the circle's edge.
 *
 * The feature tile's visual slot bleeds `2rem` right (`1.5rem` under
 * `max-lg`) but not left, so this centered vignette adds matching right
 * padding to land on the tile's visible center instead of the bled slot's
 * center. The fixed-size canvas is `shrink-0`: if it were allowed to
 * shrink at narrow tile widths its absolutely-positioned columns (fixed
 * `left-*` coordinates) would drift right of the box's true midline;
 * instead it keeps its geometry and overflows both edges equally, so the
 * Support → Review axis always sits on the tile's center. Narrow grid
 * columns are handled by the feature tile itself, which zooms its whole
 * design-space canvas down proportionally (see `SOLUTIONS_VISUAL`), so
 * this graphic never needs its own breakpoint scaling.

/**
 * Workflows platform page - a consumer of {@link SolutionsPage} rendered
 * with the enterprise page's feature-tile treatment.
 *
 * The whole page is one typed {@link SolutionsPageConfig} rendered inside
 * the shared route-group layout chrome: identity (for structured data), a
 * hero, and card rows of 3-4 cards. Every visual slot carries a feature
 * graphic in the enterprise design language - the build-methods loop and
 * deploy window reused for the stories they already tell, the monitoring
 * panel, chat answer, and audit ledger retold for scheduled runs, Slack
 * bots, and run tracing (as a 2×2 grid, so each vignette keeps its full
 * treatment), plus two workflows-specific vignettes: the mini builder
 * canvas and its code-side twin.
 *
 * The JSON-LD emitted by {@link SolutionsPage} is structurally identical
 * to the platform page's (`WebPage` + `BreadcrumbList` +
 * `WebApplication`), so the switch to feature tiles is SEO-neutral.

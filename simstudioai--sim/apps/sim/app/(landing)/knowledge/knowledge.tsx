/**
 * Knowledge Base platform page - a consumer of {@link SolutionsPage}
 * rendered with the enterprise page's feature-tile treatment.
 *
 * The whole page is one typed {@link SolutionsPageConfig} rendered inside
 * the shared route-group layout chrome: identity (for structured data), a
 * hero, and two rows of three cards. The story is agent memory - sync your
 * sources in through connectors, get answers grounded in your own docs
 * with citations, reach the same knowledge from any workflow, and let Sim
 * keep it all fresh on its own. Two knowledge-specific vignettes (the
 * connector ledger and the dark knowledge-search code window) sit beside
 * enterprise graphics retold for knowledge work: the grounded chat answer,
 * the sync-event audit ledger, and the document-processing log panel.
 *
 * The JSON-LD emitted by {@link SolutionsPage} is structurally identical
 * to the platform page's (`WebPage` + `BreadcrumbList` +
 * `WebApplication`), so the feature-tile treatment is SEO-neutral.

/**
 * Files platform page - a consumer of {@link SolutionsPage} rendered with
 * the enterprise page's feature-tile treatment.
 *
 * The whole page is one typed {@link SolutionsPageConfig} rendered inside
 * the shared route-group layout chrome: identity (for structured data), a
 * hero, and two rows of three feature tiles. The story is one file store
 * shared by the team and its agents - agents read files as inputs, produce
 * files as outputs, and every artifact lands in the same place. Every
 * visual slot carries a feature graphic in the enterprise design language:
 * two files-specific vignettes (the shared library ledger and the SDK
 * upload window) plus the switchboard, audit ledger, run monitor, and
 * document draft retold for file routing, file history, parse runs, and
 * agent-written reports.

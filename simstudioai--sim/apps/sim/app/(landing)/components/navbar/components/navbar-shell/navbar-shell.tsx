/**
 * Sticky navbar chrome that frosts to glass once the page scrolls (or, on mobile,
 * while the dropdown menu is open).
 *
 * At the very top the bar uses the same solid canvas token as the hero, so it is
 * visually seamless while still preventing route content from painting through
 * the sticky header. A 1px sentinel at the top of the landing shell's internal
 * scroll port is watched by an {@link IntersectionObserver} - no scroll listener
 * and no per-frame work. Past that point the bar gains the shared
 * {@link NAVBAR_GLASS_SURFACE} (`--bg` at 92% via `color-mix` plus a strong 40px
 * backdrop blur) - a white/glass surface built entirely from the platform's
 * light tokens, not invented colors.
 *
 * Only `background-color` is transitioned, NOT `backdrop-filter`: animating the
 * blur re-runs every time the threshold is re-crossed, which on mobile reads as a
 * vertical wobble of the bar's text as you scroll near the top. The blur snaps in
 * while the fill still fades, so the frost appears smoothly without the jitter.
 *
 * The mobile sheet reports its open state through {@link NavbarFrostContext}, so
 * opening the menu also frosts the bar - the bar and the dropdown then form one
 * continuous glass panel with no transparent seam between them.
 *
 * The frost lives on a separate sibling layer (`absolute inset-0 -z-10`) behind
 * the nav content rather than on the `<header>` element itself. This is
 * deliberate: a `backdrop-filter` ancestor establishes a backdrop root that
 * starves any descendant's own `backdrop-filter`, so a header that carried the
 * blur would render the mobile dropdown's identical glass at a fraction of the
 * strength (the dropdown is nested inside the header). With the blur on a sibling
 * layer instead, the `<header>` has no backdrop-filter, so the dropdown samples
 * the page directly and frosts at the exact same strength as the bar.
 *
 * The sentinel's height is cancelled by `-mb-px` so it contributes nothing to
 * layout flow: the sticky header sits at `y=0` from the start and never creeps
 * the 1px between its flowing and stuck positions as you begin scrolling.
 *
 * Only this shell hydrates; the nav content is server-rendered and passed through
 * as {@link children}, so the wordmark and links stay zero-hydration and crawlable.

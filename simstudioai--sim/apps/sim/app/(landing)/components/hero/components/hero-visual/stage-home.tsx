 * itself lives at the hero root (so it can outlive these layers and track its
 * target through the camera zoom + pan); this stage only lays out the card and
 * exposes the send button and reply slot as the loader's ref targets.
 *
 * - `compose` - greeting + prompt input (the typewriter).
 * - `morphing` - the instant after send: the disc morphs into the loader while
 *   the typed prompt fades. The card holds its compose height (the input stays in
 *   flow, just fading) so it never reshapes mid-morph - the disc just becomes the
 *   loader in place.
 * - `sending` - the morph is done; the prompt is now a user bubble that animates
 *   in above the loader, growing the card, while the camera holds zoomed in.
 * - `thinking` - conversation layout (user bubble + an empty reply slot whose
 *   height the loader will occupy), shown as the loader slides/docks there.
 * - `answering` - the typed reply fills the reply slot.
 * - `block` - the card morphs into the first workflow block (the chat shell
 *   resizes and its content becomes the block's), handing off to the workflow.

/**
 * Landing hero - the only `<h1>` on the page.
 *
 * A single stacked flow (no split panels): headline and the sign-up row sit
 * left-aligned at the top; below them a full-width media frame
 * previews the platform UI; the customer-logo row closes the section centered
 * underneath. The section is capped and centered at the shared `max-w-[1460px]`
 * (`mx-auto`) with the `px-20 max-lg:px-8 max-sm:px-5` gutter so the headline
 * starts on the navbar wordmark's vertical line.
 *
 * Text blocks stack a uniform 22px apart (`gap-[22px]`); the media frame and
 * logo row carry their own larger top margins to read as separate bands.
 *
 * The sign-up row is the shared {@link HeroCta} - the single source of truth for
 * the email-capture bar and the "Book a demo" / "Sign up" chips - reused
 * verbatim by every platform and solutions hero so the primary CTA never drifts.
 *
 * The media frame: the painted landscape backdrop (`hero-backdrop.jpg`,
 * rendered via `next/image` `fill` + `object-cover` with `priority` - it is the
 * LCP element) behind a white window (a soft three-part shadow stack:
 * `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` ring in place of a CSS border, plus
 * `0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` contact and `0 4px 42px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`
 * ambient shadows; no browser toolbar) filled edge to edge by the live
 * {@link HeroPlatformLoop}. The shared landing sidebar and animated Home
 * workspace render together in a fixed 1280x735 design space, so the homepage
 * stays aligned with every product and solutions hero without a baked UI
 * capture drifting behind it.
 * The frame is `1300/720` and the window `1080/620` at `83.08%` width, centered
 * - matching cursor.com's hero media proportions, with backdrop showing on all
 * four sides. Decorative, `aria-hidden`; the `--surface-3` fill remains as the
 * loading fallback under the backdrop.
 *
 * The headline/CTA column shares its row with the right-aligned
 * {@link HeroStat} (the "Global work done by Sim" figure with its vertical
 * progress rail and staggered page-load entrance), hidden below `lg` where
 * the row has no room.
 *
 * The shared {@link TrustedBy} block renders in its `row` layout - a centered
 * muted label above a single centered row of bare wordmarks.
 *
 * Carries the sr-only ~50-word product summary for AI citation (CLAUDE.md → GEO).

/**
 * Landing features - how Sim works, as a platform lifecycle. Four beats, in the
 * order you actually use Sim: bring your tools in (Integrate), give it data to
 * reason over (Context), build the agent logic (Build), then watch it run
 * (Monitor). Each beat is a Cursor-style {@link FeatureCard}: one large
 * outlined card holding a media stage (backdrop painting + elevated real-UI
 * callout) and a copy column, with the media side alternating card to card.
 *
 * The section's `<h2>` is `sr-only` - each beat carries its own visible `<h3>`,
 * so the section heading exists only to anchor the heading hierarchy and give AI
 * crawlers an atomic summary.
 *
 * Inter-section spacing is owned by the `<main>` flex `gap` in `landing.tsx`;
 * this section carries no vertical padding. The section itself is FULL-WIDTH so
 * its bottom rule can bleed to the browser edges; the card grid inside carries
 * the shared gutter (`px-20`) and the `max-w-[1460px]` cap. The last card
 * squares its bottom corners (`flushBottom`) and sits exactly on the rule, so
 * its outline merges into the full-bleed divider.
 *
 * The cards stack in a single column at every width on a 112px rhythm
 * (matching Cursor's spacing between feature cards). Below `lg` each card
 * internally reflows media-over-copy.
 *
 * Per-beat icons are still abstract placeholders (text eyebrows); distinct
 * abstract glyphs land in a later pass.

/**
 * A card row - the core repeating unit of a solutions page. A header block (an
 * `<h2>` title, a body-color subtitle, and a single pill CTA) sits above a grid
 * of cards. The grid column count is derived from `cards.length` - 3 cards render
 * `grid-cols-3`, 4 render `grid-cols-4` - so the page never specifies layout. A
 * row can opt down to a denser wrap via `row.columns` (e.g. 4 cards as a 2×2
 * grid); the grid's own gap keeps the wrapped rows at the standard inter-tile
 * rhythm.
 *
 * In the two-column band (`sm`..`lg`) a 3-card feature-tile row would leave its
 * third card orphaned beside an empty cell, so that card spans both columns and
 * switches to the tile's wide side-by-side treatment (copy left, graphic
 * right) - see {@link SolutionsCard}'s `tabletSpan`.
 *
 * Rendered as a labelled `<section>` for a clean, crawlable landmark; each card
 * is an `<article>` with an `<h3>`, keeping the strict H2 → H3 hierarchy. Every
 * gap (header sub-stack, header-to-grid, and inter-card) is owned by named
 * spacing constants. Only the row header stack can opt into centered text; card
 * text remains left aligned.

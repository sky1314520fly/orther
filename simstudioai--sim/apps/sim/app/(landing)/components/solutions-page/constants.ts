   * Mechanics, pure CSS (no JS measurement):
   * - {@link featureTileContainer} makes each tile's wrapper an inline-size
   *   query container, so `100cqw` reads the rendered column width.
   * - {@link featureTileScale} derives the factor on the tile:
   *   `tan(atan2(100cqw, 352px))` is the standard trick for dividing two
   *   lengths into a plain number, clamped to 1.
   * - {@link featureTileCanvas} is the design-space stage: an absolutely
   *   positioned layer sized `100%/scale` (= 352px wide when scaling engages)
   *   and shrunk back with `scale`, so content lays out at desktop geometry
   *   and the transform never leaves layout dead space.
   * - {@link featureTileMinHeight} tracks the scaled canvas - `440px × scale` -
   *   so the tile's height follows the zoom instead of clipping or leaving an
   *   empty band.

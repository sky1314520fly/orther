/**
 * Shared customer-logo block - the single source of truth for the wordmarks
 * shown both in the landing hero (a grid of bordered logo cards on the left half)
 * and on every platform page (a single centered row of bare wordmarks). Neither
 * consumer redefines the data or the per-logo optical sizing; they only pass a
 * `layout` intent, so the logo set reads as one system everywhere.
 *
 * Optical sizing, not box-fitting. These wordmarks differ enormously in aspect
 * ratio (Rivian|VW ≈ 11:1, eXp ≈ 2:1, Mobile Health ≈ 8:1) and in how much of their own
 * viewBox the ink fills, so a single fixed slot makes them read at wildly
 * different sizes. Each logo carries its own optically-tuned {@link Logo.height}
 * - the single knob for balancing them by eye - and renders at its intrinsic
 * {@link Logo.aspect} (width = height × aspect, rounded). Width following the
 * aspect ratio means no distortion; explicit dimensions mean zero CLS.

   *   plus their two 12px `gap-3` gutters - so it always breaks after the third
   *   card; below `xl` (where the hero/demo split collapses to a stacked
   *   column) it stretches full-width and the cards take an even share of the row,
   *   dropping to 2-up on phones (`max-sm`) so the wall never wraps early.

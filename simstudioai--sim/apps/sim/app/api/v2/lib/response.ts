 * of the pair a client actually sees. `v2Error` lets a caller override the
 * status independently of the code, so keying on the code would let the two
 * disagree.
 *
 * RFC 9110 §10.2.3 singles out 503 as the status whose `Retry-After` means "how
 * long the service is expected to be unavailable to the client", and §15.6.4
 * permits one. Note the requirement level is `MAY`, so this is a deliberate
 * improvement on the baseline rather than a conformance fix: without it a
 * client's only defensible policy on a 503 is an immediate retry, which is
 * exactly the traffic a degraded dependency cannot absorb. Sim raises 503 when
 * the API-key store, the rate-limit backend, or execution-identity allocation
 * is briefly unavailable, and all three are made
 * worse by an unthrottled retry storm.
 *
 * 429 is deliberately absent because every 429 already knows its own wait: the
 * throttle path measures it from the caller's token bucket
 * ({@link v2RateLimitError}), and an admission denial carries the descriptor's
 * declared `retryAfterSeconds` through to the route. Defaulting it here would
 * paper over a path that had simply dropped its value — which is exactly the
 * bug that used to leave a concurrency denial with no `Retry-After` at all.
 *
 * The value is Sim's one transient-failure floor, shared with the admission
 * descriptors so the execute route's capacity 429 and every other surface's 503
 * cannot drift apart. It is a floor, not a schedule: a fleet that retries at
 * exactly this offset re-converges into a single burst, so callers should still
 * add jitter — `backoffWithJitter` from `@sim/utils/retry` is what Sim's own

/**
 * POST /api/v2/files/[fileId]/restore — Bring an archived file back.
 *
 * `DELETE /api/v2/files/[fileId]` is a soft delete; this reverses it. Find the
 * ids to pass here with `GET /api/v2/files?scope=archived`.
 *
 * Restore is not a pure undo: the file returns to the workspace root regardless
 * of the folder it was deleted from, and it is renamed when its original name
 * is no longer free. The response is therefore the post-restore record, not the
 * one the caller deleted. Restoring an already-active file is a no-op that
 * returns that file, so a retried request is safe.

/**
 * GET /api/v2/chat-deployments — List a workspace's chat deployments.
 *
 * Workspace-scoped, not creator-scoped: a chat deployment is workspace
 * property, and every write on it is authorized by workspace admin.
 *
 * The only chat-deployment path that is not under a workflow, and deliberately
 * so. Every write addresses one workflow's chat singleton at
 * `/api/v2/workflows/{workflowId}/deployments/chat`, but "what does this workspace
 * serve" is a cross-parent question no per-workflow path can answer. Filter by
 * `workflowId` to resolve one workflow's chat without holding its id.
 *
 * Deliberately a narrower projection than the detail read. Discovery is a
 * `read`-level concern, so this stays callable by any workspace member and by a
 * workspace API key — which is only sound because the entries carry no
 * `allowedEmails`, `hasPassword`, or `customizations`. Those live on the
 * admin-gated detail read, so the list cannot be used to route around it.

/**
 * Records a signed-in user's approval of a CLI handoff so the waiting terminal's
 * poll can complete.
 *
 * The approving user comes from the session and nothing else — a client-supplied
 * user id here would let any caller approve a request redeemable for someone
 * else's key. No key is generated until the CLI polls.
 *
 * Workspace binding, CLI access, and permission to mint the key at all are
 * authorized here rather than at poll time: the poll is unauthenticated by
 * necessity, so it has no session to check a permission against, and re-checking
 * there would duplicate this decision while racing a permission-group change
 * made between the two calls. Approving is the only moment a human is present.
 *
 * That makes the approval record the sole carrier of the decision. The poll body
 * is a request id and a secret and nothing else, so it cannot assert a scope, a
 * workspace, or a binding of its own — a refusal here writes no record, and a
 * poll driven directly against the same request id answers `pending` forever.

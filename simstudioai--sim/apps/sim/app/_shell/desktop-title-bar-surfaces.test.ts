/**
 * Every full-viewport page root outside workspace chrome, and why it is safe.
 *
 * A root that fills the viewport and is NOT lane-aware draws its top chrome underneath
 * the macOS traffic lights, because the pre-paint script marks the lane on every desktop
 * route whether or not the page reserves it. That is one bug that has now surfaced four
 * separate times — workspace headers, signup, the CLI handoff, the OAuth error page —
 * each found by a person hitting it rather than by a check.
 *
 * So the check enumerates instead of listing what to look at: any new full-viewport root
 * fails here until it either composes `.desktop-title-bar-page` or is added below with a
 * reason.
 *
 * Known limit: a root is in scope because of how it claims the viewport, so deleting the
 * reservation outright — class gone, nothing put back — also drops the file from the check.
 * That regression is loud rather than silent (the surface stops being full height, which is
 * plainly visible), and closing it properly means treating every route entry point as a
 * window root, which pulls in seven account/organization/selfhost pages that each need
 * their own assessment. Worth doing; not worth guessing at here. Reaching for this allowlist should feel like a claim you have to defend — the
 * entry that read "marketing chrome, not reachable in the desktop shell" was false, and
 * hid four live surfaces behind one unverified sentence.
 *
 * Granularity is per FILE, not per JSX root: a file holding two full-viewport roots still
 * passes if only one reserves the lane. Catching that needs an AST pass, which is not
 * worth the weight here — the check's job is to stop a whole surface being forgotten,
 * which is how every instance of this bug actually shipped.

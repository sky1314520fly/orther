/**
 * Imported from `@c15t/nextjs/headless`, not the package root: the headless
 * entry leaves the runtime's own components and stylesheet out of the bundle,
 * so `ConsentBanner` is the only consent UI that exists. The provider still
 * injects a `<style id="c15t-theme">` block of `--c15t-*` variables that
 * nothing here reads; it is inert, since none of those names collide with
 * Sim's tokens.
 *
 * `disableAutomaticBlocking` turns off the runtime's iframe blocker, which
 * otherwise installs a `childList`/`subtree` MutationObserver on `document.body`
 * for the life of every hosted page — including the workflow canvas, the
 * highest-mutation surface in the app — and re-scans each added subtree for
 * iframes. Sim gates no iframes by consent, so it is pure overhead.

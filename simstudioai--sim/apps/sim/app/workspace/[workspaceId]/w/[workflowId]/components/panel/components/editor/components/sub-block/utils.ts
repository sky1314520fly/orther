 *
 * @remarks
 * These sub-blocks contract on a JSON string, which is what their components write. Copilot's
 * `edit_workflow` persisted them as raw arrays until it was fixed to re-serialize, so rows
 * written by older builds still hold an array. Both shapes are accepted on read.
 *
 * The element type is asserted, not validated -- callers are responsible for defaulting any
 * fields a malformed entry may be missing.
 *
 * @param value - The stored sub-block value, of unknown shape
 * @returns The parsed array, or `[]` when the value is absent, unparseable, or not an array

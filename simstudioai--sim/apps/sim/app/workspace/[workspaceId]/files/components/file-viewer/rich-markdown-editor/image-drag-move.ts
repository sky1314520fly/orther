 *
 * TipTap's image node view runs its own `dragstart`, which bypasses ProseMirror's clipboard
 * serialization — no PM `text/html`, and `view.dragging` never set — so neither ProseMirror's default
 * move nor the `slice` argument to `handleDrop` sees anything. What survives is a NodeSelection on the
 * dragged image plus the browser's native enrichment, whose html carries the absolute rendered URL of
 * exactly that node. That pair is the signal, and without acting on it the drop falls through to the
 * upload path and stores a second copy of an image the document already has.
 *
 * The move is the same shape as ProseMirror's own: compute the drop point against the pre-delete doc,
 * delete the source, then map the insert position through that delete. A null `dropPoint` (no valid
 * insertion point) is a handled no-op — the node stays put, still selected — rather than a raw-position
 * fallback, which `tr.insert` can throw on.
 *
 * The gate accepts at most one file rather than exactly one: some drag transports carry the html
 * alone. A genuinely external drop can never reference the currently selected node's own rendered src.

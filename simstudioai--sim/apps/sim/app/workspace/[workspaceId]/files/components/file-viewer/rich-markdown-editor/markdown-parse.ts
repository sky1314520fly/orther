/**
 * Split a markdown body into top-level blocks that can each be parsed independently and reassembled

 * blocks stay atomic), then adjacent groups are merged back together whenever they could form one
 * logical block: any indented (continuation) group, and consecutive list/blockquote groups (which
 * would otherwise be a single loose list/quote). Merging is intentionally conservative — over-merging
 * only yields a larger chunk, whereas under-merging would shatter a structure — and every non-empty
 * block is parsed by `@tiptap/markdown`'s own lexer, so block boundaries always match the parser.
 *
 * An EMPTY string in the result is a blank line the author left between two blocks — the exact inverse
 * of the serializer's block join (see {@link emptyBlockCount}), so a document's deliberate spacing
 * survives the round-trip instead of being silently dropped. {@link parseMarkdownToDoc} turns each into
 * an empty paragraph; a run is bounded there by {@link clampEmptyParagraphs}. Gaps are measured before
 * merging, so blank lines absorbed INTO a merged block (a loose list's own internal spacing) never
 * become paragraphs — only gaps between the final top-level blocks do. Trailing blank lines carry
 * nothing: the serializer collapses them to a single newline, so keeping them would never round-trip.
 *
 * The indent-merge rule is load-bearing for fenced code indented past 3 spaces (e.g. inside a list
 * item): {@link FENCE_OPEN} only tracks fences at the document margin, so a nested fence's interior
 * blank lines are held together by the indent merge, not the fence tracker. Weakening that merge

 * A blank line the author left between two blocks is part of the document, not noise: the chunker hands

 * the editor renders the spacing that is actually in the file — on the very first paint, with no reflow
 * once a collaborative doc settles.

 * make parse stop inverting serialize for the same document — the file would never reach a fixpoint and
 * would open read-only. So that path keeps NO empty paragraphs: consistently zero is a fixpoint, and a
 * document whose spacing cannot be represented is better rendered the way every other markdown renderer

/**
 * Editor-specific keyboard behavior layered on top of StarterKit's defaults:
 *
 * - **Backspace** at the start of a heading reverts it to a paragraph (ProseMirror's default joins or
 *   no-ops, stranding the heading style; a second Backspace then merges as usual). At the start of a
 *   *list or task item* it outdents or clears in place via {@link getListItemContext}: a nested item outdents one
 *   level, a top-level item with text lifts out of the list into a paragraph (keeping the text), and a
 *   top-level *empty trailing* (or sole) item lifts into an empty paragraph in place — so the blank
 *   bullet made by pressing Enter can be cleared back to normal text on the same line instead of being
 *   deleted with the caret jumping to the previous block. The one case lift can't take is a top-level
 *   *empty, non-trailing* item: lifting it strands an empty paragraph between the two list halves, which
 *   re-parses to a different markdown document (an empty line between list items is a loose list, not a
 *   break); that item is removed via {@link removeEmptyWrappedBlock} instead, keeping the list whole. An
 *   empty block inside a *blockquote* is likewise removed via {@link removeEmptyWrappedBlock}. At the
 *   start of a block whose previous sibling is a divider or image, where ProseMirror's `joinBackward`
 *   can't cross the leaf and no-ops: an *empty* block is deleted (clearing the blank line between/below
 *   dividers without touching the divider itself), while a *non-empty* block selects the leaf — so a
 *   first Backspace highlights what a second deletes, the same highlight-before-delete affordance as
 *   clicking it and parity with the arrow-key leaf selection.
 * - **Enter** on an empty *nested* list/task item outdents it one level, on an empty
 *   *non-trailing top-level* item removes it ({@link removeEmptyWrappedBlock}) rather than splitting the
 *   list around a stranded empty paragraph (which does not round-trip), and on an empty *trailing* item
 *   falls through to the default, which exits the list — the standard "press Enter on a blank bullet to
 *   leave the list".
 * - **Mod-A** inside a code block selects only that block's contents; pressing it again (when the
 *   block is already fully selected) falls through to the default whole-document select-all, the
 *   same scoped behavior as a code editor.
 * - **ArrowUp/ArrowDown** select an adjacent divider or image, whether arrowing off a textblock edge
 *   ({@link selectAdjacentLeaf}) or stepping from one already-selected leaf to the next
 *   ({@link selectAdjacentSelectedLeaf}). (The `Mod-Shift-Arrow` block-reorder chords live separately
 *   in `./block-mover.ts`.)
 *
 * Plus a plugin that (a) highlights dividers/images falling inside a focused range selection (e.g.
 * select-all), which the browser's native text highlight skips because leaves carry no text; hiding
 * that custom decoration on blur keeps it in sync with the native text highlight, and (b) flags the
 * editor (`data-gap-between-leaves`) while a gap cursor sits between two leaves, so the CSS can hide
 * its otherwise-stray caret.

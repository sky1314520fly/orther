 * Co-located, typed URL query-param definitions for the table-detail view.
 *
 * - `sort` is the active sort column. Columns are user-defined table columns
 *   (not a fixed set), so the column id is stored as a free-form string. A
 *   `null` value means "no active sort" — the table's natural row order — and
 *   clears from the URL.
 * - `dir` is the sort direction, following the shared `sort`+`dir` convention.
 *
 * The in-grid `filter` is intentionally NOT represented here. `Filter` is a
 * recursive, arbitrarily-nested object (`$or`/`$and` combinators, per-column
 * operator objects); serializing it would put a large structured blob in the
 * URL, which the URL-state doctrine forbids. It stays in local `useState`.
 *
 * The in-grid `find` (Cmd+F) is likewise absent, for a different reason: it is
 * a viewport cursor, not a destination. Two things rule it out. It is not one
 * value but a cluster — the term, the match cursor, and the cell the user was
 * on before opening find — and only the term is serializable; closing restores
 * that pre-find cell from an in-memory ref, so a term that survived a reload
 * would arrive with no origin to return to. And the search runs on every
 * debounced keystroke rather than on submit, which is the write frequency this
 * doctrine keeps out of the URL. Same call the browser's own Cmd+F makes.

 * Persistent chrome for the settings panel pages: the header bar, title, description, scroll

 * `secrets/[credentialId]`) keep their own chrome.
 *
 * The heading is resolved here rather than pushed up from the section body, so it renders with
 * the shell instead of waiting on the body's lazily-loaded chunk.
 *
 * Whether a segment names a section at all is decided here too, above the sibling
 * `loading.tsx`. Inside that Suspense boundary a `notFound()` or `redirect()` can no longer set
 * the response status — React replays the boundary on the client and the shell still flushes
 * 200 — so a bad or legacy URL loaded directly would answer 200 and redirect in a second round
 * trip. Deciding it above the boundary keeps the 404 and the 307. Whether the *viewer* may open
 * a section is a different question and stays in the page, where it belongs; those checks need
 * the database and are reached almost entirely by client navigation.
 *
 * Authentication is already enforced by the ancestor workspace layout, so this runs only for a
 * signed-in viewer.

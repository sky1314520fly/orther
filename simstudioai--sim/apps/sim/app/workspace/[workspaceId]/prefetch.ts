 * (including the workspace switcher header and the footer's profile row) is
 * populated without a client-side request waterfall on a cold load (e.g. after
 * the browser discards an idle tab). Calls the data layer directly — the same
 * functions the API routes use — with no internal HTTP hop.
 *
 * The host context is the authorization proof for this server-render pass, so
 * permission prefetch can reuse its effective permission without repeating
 * workspace and membership reads. It also proves the viewer has at least one
 * accessible workspace, so this pass skips the route's orphaned-workflow
 * repair, which still runs on client refetches.
 *
 * All reads run concurrently and are awaited together, so every pane is settled
 * in the cache before `dehydrate` and the sidebar still paints populated rather
 * than flashing skeletons that stream in behind the shell.
 *
 * The workspace list is seeded rather than prefetched. An empty or failed read
 * seeds nothing, leaving the client fetch to reach `GET /api/workspaces`'
 * default-workspace creation path — the same outcome a rejecting `queryFn` used
 * to produce, without routing a normal state through the error channel. That
 * matters because only a settled query is dehydrated: an unawaited read would be
 * dropped from the payload entirely, so the switcher would waterfall on every
 * cold load rather than paint populated.

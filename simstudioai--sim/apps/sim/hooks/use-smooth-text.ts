 *
 * Content that is already complete at mount (history, or a resume past
 * {@link RESUME_SKIP_THRESHOLD}) is returned in full and never animates. When a
 * live stream ends mid-reveal the remaining tail keeps draining at the paced
 * cadence rather than snapping — so the reveal stays smooth right to the end and
 * the caller can hold its streaming render until `useSmoothText` reports the
 * full string, avoiding a flash on the streaming→static handoff.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The re-arm effect runs on every committed render with a cheap
 * `rafRef === null` guard instead of keying on a `hasBacklog` dependency.
 * The frame chain self-terminates whenever the reveal catches up, and a chain
 * keyed on the `hasBacklog` boolean could die for good: when the final frame's
 * `setRevealed` and a new chunk land in the same React commit, `hasBacklog`
 * stays `true` across commits, the effect never re-fires, and the reveal
 * freezes mid-stream until remount. Re-arming per render closes that
 * interleaving while still avoiding per-chunk loop teardown (no cleanup on
 * content changes), so it cannot trip React's max-update-depth guard either.
 * If upstream sanitization rewrites earlier text and shrinks the string, the
 * cursor is pulled back to the new end so regrowth stays paced instead of
 * jumping past it.

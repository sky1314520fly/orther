/**
 * Trigger.dev wrapper for the post-fork heavy-content copy (table rows, KB
 * documents + embeddings, file blobs). Backgrounding keeps the fork request fast
 * and lets the copy survive app deploys. `maxAttempts: 1` — the copy is
 * non-transactional best-effort (per-row inserts with fresh ids), so a blind
 * re-run would duplicate rows; a partial failure simply leaves the fork's content
 * incomplete (the workflows themselves committed synchronously).
 *
 * Runs on `large-2x` (8 vCPU / 16 GB), matching `knowledge-connector-sync`: the
 * copy materializes table rows, KB chunks and their embedding vectors, and file
 * blobs in memory, and `maxAttempts: 1` means an OOM is unrecoverable — a
 * half-copied fork with no retry.

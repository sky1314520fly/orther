/**
 * Trigger.dev wrapper around `runSandboxImageBuild`. The build's lifecycle lives
 * in the `sandbox_image` row rather than the task, so this is a thin shell: the
 * runner claims the row conditionally, which makes a re-delivery a no-op.
 *
 * `maxAttempts: 1` — the runner already polls the provider to a terminal state
 * and records a classified failure the user can act on. A blind retry would just
 * race the row it already marked `failed`; the user retries by saving again.

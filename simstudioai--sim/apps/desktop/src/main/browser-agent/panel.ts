 * used to also predict a rect on the window's own `resize` event, on the
 * premise that the panel was right-anchored at a constant width — true only
 * after a divider drag pins an inline pixel width. The panel's default is
 * `w-1/2`, so the prediction was wrong by half the frame's window travel and,

 * other's key and applied a different rect twice per frame. That double
 * compositor resize was the "swimming" the prediction was meant to prevent.
 * A divider drag still gets a predicted rect, from the renderer, where the
 * arithmetic is exact because only the panel's left edge moves.
 *
 * The window's `resize` does drive this function (see {@link bindHostResize}),
 * but only as a trigger — it supplies no rect. The report the renderer already
 * sent is re-clamped against the new content box, so a shrink can never leave
 * the view overhanging the frame while that report is one frame stale. The
 * clamp needs no model of where the panel sits, which is exactly what the
 * reverted prediction did need. Bounds keep one writer and one dedup key, so
 * the contention above cannot recur: on a grow the clamp is inert and the key

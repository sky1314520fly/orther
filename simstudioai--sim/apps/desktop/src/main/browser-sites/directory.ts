 * Sim's browser records no history, so it cannot learn on its own that
 * `mail.google.com` is Gmail. This is the answer to that, captured once at
 * import time from the browser that did know, for the hosts being imported
 * anyway. It is a name and an icon per host — never a visit log, never a URL
 * beyond the host itself.
 *
 * Encrypted with the same OS-backed key as the credential vault. The hostnames
 * in here include ones only a saved password knows about, and those live in an
 * encrypted vault today; writing them to a plaintext file beside it would
 * quietly undo that.

/**

 * offered as suggestions in their own right, and carrying the old set forward
 * would put exactly the origins this design rejects into the dropdown. `read`
 * discards a foreign version, so the upgrade costs a re-import — the right
 * trade for a cache of someone else's data that is now user-visible.

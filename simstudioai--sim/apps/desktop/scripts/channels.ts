 * app.setName() from its baked origin at startup, which decides the userData
 * directory and single-instance lock — and this is what the packager stamps
 * into the bundle. When the two disagree, the bundle on disk and the running
 * app disagree about which app they are: a dev-pointed build packaged as
 * "Sim.app" with the production bundle id installs over a real production
 * install while naming itself "Sim Dev" at runtime.

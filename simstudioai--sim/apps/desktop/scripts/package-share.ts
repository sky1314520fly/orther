/**
 * Share build: packages distributable .dmg/.zip artifacts from the current
 * checkout, signed with whatever identity is on the machine (no notarization,
 * no trusted timestamps) — the "send someone a build to try" loop.
 *
 *   bun run package:share                    # production only
 *   bun run package:share --all              # all four channels
 *   bun run package:share --staging --dev    # just these two
 *   bun run package:share --dir              # skip dmg/zip, package the .app only (fast)
 *   SIM_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_ORIGIN=https://sim.acme.example bun run package:share
 *
 * Each channel lands in release/<slug>/ with artifacts named for it — sim,
 * sim-staging, sim-dev, sim-local. electron-builder.yml's artifactName is a
 * single literal ("Sim-${version}-${arch}"), so without the override every
 * channel writes the same filename and the last build silently wins. Only this
 * path overrides it: the release workflow publishes one channel per GitHub
 * release, where the flat name is what electron-updater expects.
 *
 * The baked origin decides the bundle identity, exactly as it decides the
 * runtime one. This used to shell straight into electron-builder, which took
 * productName/appId from electron-builder.yml — always the production pair — so
 * a dev-pointed share packaged as "Sim.app" with the production bundle id while
 * naming itself "Sim Dev" at runtime.
 *
 * Channels build ONE AT A TIME on purpose. scripts/build.ts writes the bundle
 * to dist/ and the app icon to build/generated-icon.icon, both fixed paths, so
 * concurrent channels would overwrite each other's bundle mid-package and ship
 * a dmg whose baked origin belongs to a different environment — invisible until
 * someone signs in. Giving each channel its own bundle directory is what would
 * make concurrency safe, and the flag that redirects the app entry point
 * (-c.extraMetadata.main) rewrites this package.json IN THE SOURCE TREE,
 * stripping scripts and devDependencies. If parallelism is worth it later, the
 * way to get it is a per-channel project directory (electron-builder --project)
 * — not extraMetadata.

/**
 * Rebuilds a stored retry policy as a real {@link BlockRetryConfig} instead of
 * asserting that the raw `jsonb` blob already is one.
 *
 * The column is written verbatim by writers that never validate its contents —
 * the realtime batch-add and replace-state ops take untyped block records, and
 * the admin/superuser import routes persist externally-authored workflow JSON —
 * so a row can hold an out-of-range number, a missing field, or a non-boolean
 * flag. Pinning the values here is the policy the feature declares (see
 * `resolveBlockRetryConfig`) and applies it to every reader at once: the editor
 * renders exactly the numbers execution will use, and the strict HTTP contract
 * that serves this state can never reject a workflow it is meant to open.
 *
 * `enabled` is carried across rather than resolved, so the numbers a builder
 * configured survive switching retry off and back on. That is why
 * `resolveBlockRetryConfig` — which collapses a disabled policy to `null` —
 * must not be used on this path.

/**
 * Stored subflow config coerced to the string the loaded shape declares.
 *
 * `config` is schemaless JSONB and the writers are looser than the readers:
 * `?? ''` only replaces `null`/`undefined`, so an object or number written into
 * `whileCondition` or `doWhileCondition` survived to a consumer whose schema
 * asserts `z.string()`. On the v2 read that is a `500` on a workflow that opens
 * fine in the editor. Non-strings are preserved as JSON rather than dropped, so
 * nothing a caller wrote is lost.
 *
 * `forEachItems` and `distribution` deliberately do NOT go through this: both
 * are declared `unknown[] | Record<string, unknown> | string` in
 * `@sim/workflow-types` and published as that union by the v2 read schema, so a
 * stored array is correct data rather than a shape to coerce.

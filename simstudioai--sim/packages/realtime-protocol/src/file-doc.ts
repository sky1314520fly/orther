 *    the document being both synced AND seeded — otherwise an empty/still-syncing doc could be saved
 *    over the real file (the one true data-loss path).
 * 2. **One provider per socket.** Destroy the previous provider before creating the next (document
 *    switch), so a stale provider's binary-frame listener can't apply another document's updates.
 * 3. **Treat a fatal (`retryable: false`) join error as terminal.** Latch it and fall back to a
 *    read-only view of the file's stored content — do not keep rejoining. The server auto-reclaims a

/**
 * Prism.js highlighting utilities isolated in a dedicated module.
 *
 * The grammar imports above are side-effectful (they register languages on the
 * shared `Prism.languages` registry), which marks any module that statically
 * imports them as having side effects and therefore non-tree-shakeable. Keeping
 * them here — rather than in `code.tsx` — ensures Prism only enters bundles that
 * actually import these utilities, instead of every consumer of the shared
 * `@sim/emcn` barrel (which re-exports `Code`).
 *
 * `code.tsx` itself never imports this module statically; it loads it lazily via
 * dynamic `import()` on first highlight.
 *
 * `highlight` is a local wrapper rather than a re-export of Prism's `highlight`.
 * A bare re-export lets bundlers resolve the binding straight from `prismjs` and
 * skip this module's body, dropping the grammar registrations above so
 * `languages.json` (etc.) become `undefined` at runtime. Owning the function
 * keeps the registrations in the dependency graph and lets us degrade to escaped
 * plaintext when a grammar is missing instead of throwing.

/**
 * Shared types for the Sim browser agent — the agent browser built into the
 * Sim desktop app.
 *
 * The Sim web app (renderer) invokes browser tools through the desktop
 * preload bridge (`window.simDesktop.browserAgent`); the Electron main
 * process executes them against a dedicated, persistent-profile browser view
 * that is embedded INSIDE the main Sim window, positioned exactly over the
 * chat's browser panel. The panel is therefore natively interactive — the
 * user clicks and types into the real page, no frame streaming or synthetic
 * input. Both sides consume this package for tool identity, shared timeout
 * policy, and bridge envelopes. Individual tool parameters and results are
 * still validated by the desktop driver rather than statically mapped here.
 *
 * Current tool names mirror the mothership tool catalog
 * (`copilot/internal/tools/catalog/browser` in the mothership repo). This
 * package also retains retired names needed to replay persisted chat history.
 * The catalog is the source of truth for what the model can call; this package
 * is the source of truth for how current and compatible legacy calls travel to
 * the desktop main process.

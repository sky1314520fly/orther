 * The user and the agent share the same shells, so `cd`, exported variables,

 * One is active at a time; agent tools act on the active one unless they name
 * another.

 * (`copilot/internal/tools/catalog/terminal` in the mothership repo) — that
 * catalog is the source of truth for what the model can call; this package is
 * the source of truth for how those calls travel to the desktop main process.

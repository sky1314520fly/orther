 * All or nothing. Only multi-segment camelCase is safely rewritable in prose —
 * see {@link WIRE_IDENTIFIER} — so a sentence enumerating both kinds came out
 * half in one vocabulary and half in the other: `At least one of name,
 * description, or --folder is required` reads as three different things, one of
 * which is a flag. When a single-word field of the same operation survives the
 * pass, the whole message is left as the server wrote it: entirely in wire
 * names, which is at least internally consistent and matches the REST
 * reference the caller can look the names up in.
 *
 * The veto reads the message the server sent, not the rewritten one: a flag
 * spelling contains its own field name, so re-scanning the output would let a
 * successful translation veto itself.
 *
 * The cost is that a message mentioning `folderPath` and the English word
 * `name` loses a translation it could have had. That is the deliberate trade —
 * telling the two apart is the undecidable problem that produced the mixed
 * sentence in the first place, and an unhelpful sentence beats a misleading one.

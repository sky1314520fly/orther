/**
 * The CLI contract: how the terminal surface maps onto the v2 API.
 *
 * Most of a command is derivable and is NOT stated here. Method, path, path
 * params, field types, enum values, defaults, and required-ness all come from
 * the generated operation table, which comes from the Zod route contracts. The
 * command name itself usually derives from `<resource> <sub-resource> <verb>`.
 *
 * This file carries only what a schema cannot say:
 *
 * - `command` — when the derived name collides or reads badly. REST overloads
 *   one path for single and bulk (`DELETE /rows` vs `DELETE /rows/[rowId]`), so
 *   those need a human to pick `delete` vs `batch-delete`.
 * - `flags` — when a field's *type* misdescribes its *meaning*. `workflowIds`
 *   is `z.string()` that the route splits on commas; nothing in the schema says
 *   "list". Also friendlier aliases (`conflictTarget` → `--on`).
 * - `pathFlags` — when a parent path segment is command context rather than the
 *   resource being acted on (`workflows runs get <runId> --workflow <id>`).
 * - `pathArgumentNames` — when a route's generic `[id]` needs a clearer CLI
 *   placeholder (`<knowledgeBaseId>`).
 * - `profileWorkspacePath` — when `[workspaceId]` is the active profile target,
 *   not a resource argument (`workspaces get`).
 * - `columns` — which of a response's fields belong in a table. Editorial.
 * - `confirm` — which operations are destructive enough to demand `--yes`.
 *
 * An operation with nothing unusual needs no entry at all.

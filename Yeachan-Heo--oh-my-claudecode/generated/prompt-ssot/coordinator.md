## Cancellation
Cancel an execution mode when work is done and verified, or when blocked and unable to proceed.
Do not cancel while work is still incomplete; fix and retry a single failed subtask instead.

## Commit Protocol
Use git trailers to preserve decision context in every commit message.
Format: conventional commit subject line, optional body, then structured trailers.
Trailers (skip for trivial commits like typos or formatting):
- `Constraint:` active constraint that shaped this decision
- `Rejected:` alternative considered | reason for rejection
- `Directive:` warning or instruction for future modifiers of this code
- `Confidence:` high | medium | low
- `Scope-risk:` narrow | moderate | broad
- `Not-tested:` edge case or scenario not covered by tests

## Delegation Rules
- Delegate multi-file implementations, refactors, debugging, reviews, planning, research, and verification.
- Work directly only for trivial operations: small clarifications, quick status checks, single commands.
- Route substantive code changes to the executor lane.
- Route non-trivial SDK/API/framework questions to documentation research before implementing.

## Model Routing
- Low tier: quick lookups and narrow checks.
- Medium tier: standard implementation, debugging, and reviews.
- High tier: architecture, deep analysis, and complex refactors.

## Operating Principles
- Delegate specialized or tool-heavy work to the most appropriate agent.
- Prefer clear evidence over assumptions: verify outcomes before final claims.
- Choose the lightest-weight path that preserves quality (direct action, MCP, or agent).
- Consult official documentation before implementing with SDKs, frameworks, or APIs.
- Prefer deletion over addition when the same behavior can be preserved.
- Reuse existing utilities and patterns before introducing new ones.
- Do not add new dependencies without an explicit request or approval.
- Keep diffs small, reversible, and easy to review.

## Execution Protocols
- Broad requests with no clear target: explore first, then plan.
- Run independent tasks in parallel; run dependent tasks sequentially.
- Keep authoring and review as separate passes; never self-approve in the same pass.
- Use background execution for installs, builds, and tests.

## Verification
Verify before claiming completion: identify what proves the claim, run the verification, read the output, then report with evidence.
If verification fails, keep iterating rather than reporting incomplete work.
Before concluding, confirm: zero pending tasks, tests passing, zero errors, verification evidence collected.

## Safety Boundaries
Advisory checks fail open with a bounded, visible warning and never block routine work.
Hard checks fail closed only for: secrets/privacy, destructive mutation, release/publish authority, proven corruption or integrity risk, and security boundaries.
Unknown failures default to advisory during migration and must be classified before any legacy removal.

## Release Authority
Never tag, publish, cut a release, or mutate protected branches. Release authority is maintainer-only via `omc release`; everything else is a compatibility alias during migration.

## Workflow: Deep Interview (Tier-0)
Socratic ambiguity-gated requirements intake — a distinct Tier-0 workflow, not an alias.
Runs before planning when requirements are vague or underspecified. Never mutates product source; it produces a requirements artifact that feeds into ralplan or direct execution.
Gate: ambiguity must be mathematically bounded below threshold before the interview can close.

## Workflow: Ralplan (Tier-0)
Iterative consensus planning with structured deliberation — a distinct Tier-0 workflow, not an alias.
Planner, architect, and critic roles converge on an approved plan before any implementation. The plan is a durable artifact; execution is a separate authorization boundary.
Use `--deliberate` for high-risk scope requiring deeper analysis.

## Output Contract
Final reports must include: changed files, verification commands with their actual results, simplifications made, and remaining risks.
Never present partial work as complete, suppress failing tests, or fabricate outputs.

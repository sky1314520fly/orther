# #3668 — `ralph` vs official `ralph-loop` namespace: evaluation + owner-decision hold

Status: **owner-decision hold** (no rename/removal of bare `ralph`; no release files)
Branch: `fix/issue-3668-ralph-namespace` (dev `656d855ef`)
Date: 2026-08-10
Owner decision required: see **Recommendation**.

## Summary

omc ships the bare skill name `ralph` (`/ralph`). The official Anthropic
`claude-plugins-official` plugin ships the same technique as `ralph-loop`
(`/ralph-loop`). When both plugins are installed, a user typing `/ralph`
gets omc's loop with no indication that a second implementation is installed.
#3668 records this as a namespace/product decision for the owner.

This branch evaluates the options with exact evidence and implements the
cheapest non-breaking mitigation (Option 1: concise invocation-time notice),
leaving the rename (Option 2) as an explicit owner decision.

## Reproduced layout (both plugins installed)

```
~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/ralph-loop/1.0.0/
  commands/ralph-loop.md        -> /ralph-loop   (official)
~/.claude/plugins/cache/omc/oh-my-claudecode/<version>/skills/ralph/SKILL.md
  name: ralph                   -> /ralph        (omc)
~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json  (machine-readable registry)
  "ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official": [{ installPath, version, enabled }]
  "oh-my-claudecode@omc": [{ installPath, version, enabled }]
```

Before this change, the omc keyword-detector emitted `[MAGIC KEYWORD: RALPH]`
with zero mention of the official plugin.

## What OMC can reliably detect at `/ralph` invocation (no private-payload scan)

Two independent signals, both already-familiar OMC surfaces, mirroring the
installer's `hasEnabledOmcPlugin` semantics (`src/installer/index.ts`):

1. **INSTALLED** — `[$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR|~/.claude]/plugins/installed_plugins.json`
   (the file OMC's installer/auto-update already owns for plugin-cache
   bookkeeping) contains the exact official id `ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official`
   and `commands/ralph-loop.md` exists under the entry's `installPath`.
   The registry's own `enabled` flag is **deliberately not consulted**: it does
   not authoritatively encode enablement (a plugin disabled through canonical
   settings can still carry `enabled: true`, and vice versa).
2. **ENABLED** — the effective Claude Code settings for the *active project*
   enable the plugin. Scopes are consulted highest-precedence-first, exactly as
   Claude Code resolves settings: `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json`,
   `<project>/.claude/settings.json`, then
   `[$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR|~/.claude]/settings.json`. The first scope that mentions
   the official id decides; scopes that never mention it are transparent. Within
   a file, the canonical `enabledPlugins` field decides (legacy `plugins` field
   accepted for backward compatibility), either as an array of plugin ids or as
   a map whose value is not `false`. Missing, malformed, or field-less settings
   are treated as **not enabled**, exactly like the installer.

   The project root comes from the hook payload's `cwd`/`directory`, which is
   caller-supplied: only an absolute path is accepted, so a relative or
   traversal fragment can never be joined onto the hook process cwd to read
   settings from an arbitrary directory (it falls back to the hook's own cwd).

Never open any SKILL.md / command body / payload — the only file-existence
probe is `existsSync` on `commands/ralph-loop.md`.

Measured cost (invocation-time only, no startup scan): ~0.08 ms median for the
registry read + settings read + existence probes vs ~150-335 ms total hook
invocation. When the official plugin is absent or disabled the added cost is
two `existsSync` probes (~microseconds) and the output is byte-identical to
today.

## Implemented option (G002): non-breaking disambiguation notice

- Files: `scripts/keyword-detector.mjs` and `templates/hooks/keyword-detector.mjs`
  (the two packaged artifacts that are kept in lockstep — see
  `src/installer/__tests__/hook-templates.test.ts`).
- Behavior: only when `ralph` is among the routed skills (single-skill or
  multi-skill routing such as `/ralph ultrawork`) AND the official plugin is
  installed and enabled, the invocation guide gains one line:

  > Note: the official Anthropic \`ralph-loop\` plugin is also installed.
  > \`/ralph\` runs OMC's ralph; use \`/ralph-loop\` for the official plugin.

- Verified matrix (both artifacts, automated regression test A–P3):
  | Case | Outcome |
  |---|---|
  | A. installed + enabled (`enabledPlugins` map) | notice present |
  | A2. `enabledPlugins` as array of ids | notice present |
  | B. official absent from registry (settings enables) | silent (identical output) |
  | C. disabled in settings (`enabledPlugins: false`) | silent — enablement from settings, not registry flag |
  | C2. settings has neither field | silent |
  | D. registry entry, payload missing | silent (no fabrication) |
  | E. lookalike id only (`my-ralph-loop@community`) | silent (settings-side lookalike too) |
  | F. no registry | silent |
  | G. non-ralph skill (autopilot) | silent |
  | H. official `/ralph-loop` command | never routes to OMC, never carries notice |
  | I. `/omc-ralph` alias | routes to OMC ralph with notice |
  | J. registry `enabled: false` + settings enabled | notice present (settings wins) |
  | K. registry `enabled: true` + settings missing | silent (missing settings = not enabled) |
  | L. legacy `plugins` map | notice present |
  | M. malformed settings.json | silent (fail closed) |
  | N. config root via `HOME` (no `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) | notice present |
  | O. same-named community plugin enabled, official `false` | silent (ids match on the full `name@marketplace` id) |
  | O2. `enabledPlugins` array with only `ralph-loop@community` | silent |
  | O3. bare marketplace-less `ralph-loop` id | silent (not the official id) |
  | O4. canonical `enabledPlugins: false` + legacy `plugins: true` | silent (canonical field wins) |
  | P. multi-skill routing (`/ralph ultrawork`) | notice present (no multi-skill bypass) |
  | P2. multi-skill routing without ralph | silent |
  | P3. multi-skill routing, official disabled | silent |
  | Q1. project `.claude/settings.json` disables, user enables | silent (project wins, single + multi-skill) |
  | Q2. project `settings.local.json` enables, project `settings.json` disables | notice present (local wins) |
  | Q3. project enables, user scope absent | notice present |
  | Q4. project scope never mentions the plugin | user scope still decides |
  | Q5. malformed project settings | silent (fail closed) |
  | Q6. privacy: notice carries no settings path or settings content | notice present, no path/field leakage |
  | Q7. relative / traversal payload cwd | ignored (absolute-only), same dir as absolute path IS honored |
- `/ralph` routing and the full invocation text are unchanged except the note.
- Suites: `hook-templates.test.ts` 18/18, `keyword-detector-script.test.ts`
  101/101, `src/installer/__tests__` + keyword-detector suites 411/411,
  `npm run lint` (0 errors) + `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## Option comparison: notice (implemented) vs rename/alias

| Dimension | Option 1: notice (implemented) | Option 2: rename to `omc-ralph` / alias |
|---|---|---|
| Command surface delta | none | `/ralph` disappears or becomes an alias; every muscle-memory user breaks |
| Keyword activation (`ralph` / 랄프 / ラルフ) | unchanged | must be re-pointed in 3 detector copies (93 `ralph` pattern references in keyword-detector artifacts) |
| Mode/state keys (`mode="ralph"`, `ralph-state.json`) | unchanged | would orphan live session state; cancel skill's `state_read/state_clear(mode="ralph")` cascade breaks without a migration |
| Workflow-slot registry (`CANONICAL_WORKFLOW_SKILLS`, bridge slash list, workflow-stage enum) | unchanged | 14+ command-surface files must change in lockstep |
| `keywordDetector.disabled` config (`["ralph"]`) | unchanged | silently stops matching; user configs break |
| Plugin-cache upgrade | n/a | every version dir is a full payload copy; rename only applies on the *next* cache version, leaving mixed old/new names across stale-cache symlinks until purge |
| Docs surface | none required | 8+ user-facing docs must be rewritten; README command table changes |
| Owner risk | minimal, additive | high: material command-surface change |

Quantified surface for a rename: 246 non-test files reference `ralph`
(14 command-surface files, 24 mode/state-key files, 8 user docs) plus the
`skills/ralph/` directory move and the plugin.json skill entry.

## Recommendation (owner decision)

1. **Adopt Option 1** — the notice is live on this branch, non-breaking,
   and removes the silent substitution for exactly the affected population.
2. **Do not rename/remove bare `ralph`** without an explicit owner decision;
   the rename breaks keyword activation, live session state, cancel cascade,
   workflow slots, user `keywordDetector.disabled` configs, and docs — a
   material command-surface change that this branch must not merge on its own.
3. If the owner later wants Option 2, it should be a separate explicit
   migration (alias first, deprecate over ≥1 release, migrate state keys,
   update 3 detector copies + slots + docs), never a rename-only PR.

## Files changed on this branch

- `scripts/keyword-detector.mjs` — notice helper + ralph wiring
- `templates/hooks/keyword-detector.mjs` — same, lockstep artifact
- `src/installer/__tests__/hook-templates.test.ts` — regression A–G for both artifacts

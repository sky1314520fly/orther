/**
 * Epoch ownership single-writer fence over `<runsRoot>/<run_id>/owner.lock`.
 *
 * Protocol (normative; implements frozen OwnershipFence):
 * - Creation is always O_CREAT|O_EXCL; every removal/move is an atomic
 *   rename to a unique tombstone. There is no read-then-unlink anywhere
 *   against the live lock path (#3555 defect class).
 * - Stale = PID dead OR unparseable content, AND older than the grace
 *   period. A live healthy holder yields busy — fail-closed (AC-7).
 * - Takeover: rename(lock -> tombstone) — exactly one racer wins (the rest
 *   observe ENOENT/EEXIST/EPERM and retry); the winner reads the old epoch
 *   from the tombstone it now exclusively owns and re-creates the lock at
 *   old_epoch + 1 (AC-4).
 * - Epoch continuity: `<run_dir>/owner.epoch` sidecar records the highest
 *   epoch ever issued (plain integer text, atomically persisted while we
 *   exclusively hold the lock). New creations never reissue an epoch the
 *   sidecar has seen, so resume after release keeps advancing past journal
 *   history instead of restarting at 1.

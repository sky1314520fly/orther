/**
 * Skill Active State Management (v2 mixed schema)
 *
 * `skill-active-state.json` is a dual-copy workflow ledger:
 *
 *   {
 *     "version": 2,
 *     "active_skills": {                    // workflow-slot ledger
 *       "<canonical workflow skill>": {
 *         "skill_name": ...,
 *         "started_at": ...,
 *         "completed_at": ...,              // soft tombstone
 *         "parent_skill": ...,              // lineage for nested runs
 *         "session_id": ...,
 *         "mode_state_path": ...,
 *         "initialized_mode": ...,
 *         "initialized_state_path": ...,
 *         "initialized_session_state_path": ...
 *       }
 *     },
 *     "support_skill": {                    // legacy-compatible branch
 *       "active": true, "skill_name": "plan", ...
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * HARD INVARIANTS:
 *   1. `writeSkillActiveStateCopies()` is the only helper allowed to persist
 *      workflow-slot state. Every workflow-slot write, confirm, tombstone, TTL
 *      pruning, and hard-clear must update BOTH
 *        - `.omc/state/skill-active-state.json`
 *        - `.omc/state/sessions/{sessionId}/skill-active-state.json`
 *      together through this single helper.
 *   2. Support-skill writes go through the same helper so the shared file
 *      never drops the `active_skills` branch.
 *   3. The session copy is authoritative for session-local reads; the root
 *      copy is authoritative for cross-session aggregation.

 * - user_cancel, user_interrupt: Likely user-initiated via UI
 * - ctrl_c: Terminal interrupt (Ctrl+C)
 * - manual_stop: Explicit stop button
 * - abort, cancel: Generic abort patterns
 *

 * In practice it can also describe a turn interruption caused by a new user
 * message arriving during long-running tool execution (issue #2478). Those
 * interrupted turns should still allow Ralph/persistent-mode resume on the
 * next stop-hook opportunity unless stronger explicit-cancel signals exist.
 *
 * NOTE: Per official Anthropic docs, the Stop hook "Does not run if
 * the stoppage occurred due to a user interrupt." This means this
 * function may never receive user-abort contexts in practice.
 * It is kept as defensive code in case the behavior changes.
 *
 * If the hook fails to detect user aborts correctly, these patterns

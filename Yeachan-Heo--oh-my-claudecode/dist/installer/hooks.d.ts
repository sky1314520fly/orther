/**
 * Hook Scripts for Claude Code
 * Hook system inspired by oh-my-opencode, adapted for Claude Code's native hooks
 *
 * Claude Code hooks are configured in settings.json and run as shell commands.
 * These scripts receive JSON input via stdin and output JSON to modify behavior.
 *
 * This module provides Node.js scripts (.mjs) for cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
 * Bash scripts were deprecated in v3.8.6 and removed in v3.9.0.
